2277,"Gang stalked and harassed by faculty members after I was no longer a student. A male faculty who works with the Veteran students at CCBC made me aware that his wife no longer has sex with him. Each time I had to register for classes, he would take me aside and ask deep personal questions about my life. He told me that he had sexual dreams about me. He made sure that my file was always hidden on his desk. No one else could touch my file. They couldn't even find it. It was normal procedure for me to be forced to wait there for up to 2 hours while they fiddled around looking for my file, called my professors to make sure I could take the class, emailed them and insisted I wait for an email response, and whatever else they were doing. I always had permission to be in the class from the professors and the VA doesn't care what classes I take, so long as this is an accreditted college. So because the admin person was sexually harassing me, I was also forced to endure mistreatment based on my protective status as a veteran. After everything was filled out, this sexual harasser would then insist on sitting down and reviewing my entire career at the school, claiming he could not read his writing. When I complained to the head of the VA, he insisted angrily that the sexual harasser worked in the finance office. That he does but he also represented the Veterans at the school. The head of the VA department for CCBC did not care that I was being sexually harassed or that I was forced to wait 2 hours at the Veterans desk at the finance office. He wasn't listening and was instead angry that I refused to go to his frat party where alcohol was served. He then insisted that I was mentally ill for using the adult words, ""CYA"" and ""BS."" What I meant was that these people refused to allow me to leave their office until they had covered their butts that the class was paid for and that I would not sue CCBC if I took an elective for fun that I wanted, seeing as I already have a degree and the classes I took with them were just for fun. And it is totally BS that they would force me to stand there and wait in their office for hours while they track down professors who have a life. I said nothing wrong but this abusive faculty member told me I was insane and that he was calling the behavioral health department to punish me for speaking  up to him about the sexual abuse, harassment I had received at CCBC. I had already told him that I had quit the campus a week before. Needless to say the abusive woman at the behavioral health department called me on my cell despite the fact that she had in writing that I was no longer a studdent, and she left a voicemail telling me she would recommend me mental  health treatments. I called her back and asked her to quit stalking me since she knew I was not a student and she had no legal right to call me and because I had done nothing wrong.

1248,"Fall 2015, I started my PhD in a new program in the same college where I need received my masters. I was at an orientation get-together for new and current grad students at a local restaurant/bar. Only one prof showed up, but he was drunk, high, and disheveled when he showed up. I thought he was another grad student. 

I didn't chat much with him because I felt his presence, especially in the inebriated condition he was in, was inappropriate. It wasn't long before he made small talk, we discussed the upcoming semester, he assumed I was taking his philosophy course, but I hadn't told him I wasn't because I'd already had philosophy in my masters program. He asked how I felt about the program and I told him I thought I'd have a good time. He smirked, grabbed his beer, chuckled a bit, and said ""I'll make sure of it"" as he took a sip. 

I was so shocked, I sat there for 5 minutes trying to decide if I heard him correctly. My 14yo daughter was there so I got up and we left. The professor said ""see you in class"" and I told him I wouldn't be there. He was shocked and we left. 

I come from tech and am used to off-color comments, but for some reason, this threw me. After a few days I started taking to folks. One, a grad student who was friends with the prof tried to blow it off, ""he always says that, it is nothing!"" And I kept asking myself, and that student, since when does that excuse the behavior? 

Another grad student, male, described a situation where in the philosophy class I was not taking, he witnessed the prof being affectionate toward the female grad students, who happened to be primarily Asian. Then the Prof boasted of his sexual conquests with female Asian grad students in the past to my friend while walking to the bar for class (he held class in the local bars all the time). I was going to let his behavior toward me pass, 

I ended up calling a prof friend in my program and described this whole situation to her. She said they've had suspicion this was happening but no one willing to report it officially. So she suggested I go to the department chair and grad director. I did and they were very supportive and understanding, suggested I go to the Title IX office and file a complaint. It's worth noting that by this time i started feeling depressed.

I filed my report and the Title IX  office kept losing track of it's progress. Nearly six months later and they finally determined that the words the prof spoke we're harmless, he admitted to speaking them, and there was nothing to address other than to have a talk with him about how his words can be misinterpreted and require mandatory sexual harassment training as part of the grad school orientation program for this college. 

When the grad director for sat down with me to go over the report, he want nearly as supportive. Quite the opposite. When the topic of the sexual harassment training came up, the way he introduced it to me was ""now, because of you, we had to add an extra hour to the orientation program."" I shot up and left his office without saying anything else, then informed him a week later I would not return to the program. More gender bias I did not need.

Other colleagues agreed he was ""creepy."" Fast forward 10 years. I was now department chair and it came to my attention that this same guy, who taught poetry writing, was making female undergraduates pretty uncomfortable. Rather than teaching everyone together in a classroom, he held tutorials in his tiny office with the door closed so that he could work with each individual student on her writing. One student came forward when she received an envelope of poems at her home address (which she had not shared with him -- he had gotten the registrar to tell him where she lived). Although he would deny it, the poems were highly suggestive and personal, mentioning, for example, a tattoo on her leg and the street she lived on. He also called her on her cell phone and asked her questions about her boyfriend. He would have students bring some of their art to class so he could help them translate their inspiration into words; in her case he honed in on a photograph in which she appeared in the background, in the shadows, partly nude. (This was in that tiny office with the door closed.) The student filed a complaint, and I had her taken out of the class and asked another colleague to work with her through the rest of the semester so that she could get credit for the course. This was just the first incident. This student filed a complaint which was adjudicated through a complex system that included both the in-house sexual harassment procedure and the state-wide faculty union grievance process. His defense was that he was working very hard with each student to draw out their creative energy based on what he saw in their work, and of course, they explored all kinds of subjects in their work. The fact that they were 20 years old and he was somewhere in his 70s, supposedly mature enough to know where to draw the line, did not seem to register. He had several advocates in the department, all male and quite senior to me, who argued that his writing poems for the students was a matter of free speech, and that stopping it would cast a shadow over the principles of artistic freedom at the school. The poet was able to keep his job with a stern warning, an order not to have students in his office alone, and a remedial sexual harassment training program -- something required by state law that had not really been enforced for adjunct faculty, putting the university in a position of potential liability. He came to my office in the fall and told me he was very sorry, he now understood, and I would never have any trouble with him again. I told him I hoped he meant it. But of course he kept up the same behavior, choosing new students for his obsession each term. After the students saw that he had not been fired, they were very reluctant to bring new complaints against him, and feeling very upset that I had not been able to get justice for the first student, I did not feel I could push them to complain, as I could make no promises. I could only take the incident to the civil rights officer, but without a formal complaint we could go no further. Every time I went to him and told him I knew what he was up to, he wanted to know who complained, and whined about how he had a constitutional right to face his accuser. He denied and denied, and begged me not to take away the only meaningful thing left in his life. After a couple of these incidents he seems to have understood he couldn't do this with students in his class, but decided it would be ok to stalk random students he saw in the halls. Two years after my term was up, he turned his attention to a graduate student, followed her to the cafeteria, invited himself to have lunch with her, offered to help her with recommendations, etc. She didn't like it but she felt she had to be polite to a professor. Then he wrote a little play and e-mailed it to her. There was immediately a second e-mail saying ""maybe you shouldn't open that other e-mail but just delete it."" Naturally she opened it. It was very explicit. She brought it to public safety, who called HR, and at last he was escorted out of the building and banned from campus. The grievance procedure dragged on for over a year with his old friends declaiming over and over the violation of his civil rights, but the firing was upheld at last.",Chair of a large liberal arts department,Chair of a large liberal arts department,Adjunct professor,Male,Male,Art History,Other Type of School,Head,Faculty,Humanities

323,"From day one of being hired, I was pursued sexually by my department chair. I was 30, he was 55. He would openly announce his attraction to me in front of students and colleagues. He would openly in front of others express his love for me, describing that he felt about me the same love and attraction as he did for his wife when he first met her. Seeing me, even from afar, would lead to his coming my way to hug me, compliment my looks, my attire, my smile. He would refer to me as his very own Greek goddess. He would call me to meetings in his office to tell me his personal problems and seek my care of him, which when I did not give, made me pursue me all the more fiercely. He declared he needed to be a student in my class to learn from me, and attended every class session for my first semester. He would challenge most everything I said in class. After class, he would stand with his groin in my face as I sat in a deskchair talking with students after class. He would block me from getting out of the chair, so that he could keep his dick close to my mouth. One time as I was bending over to pick up my bag, he ran to the front of the room to put his dick in my face so that when I stood up, my face made contact with his entire crotch. I reported each incident to colleagues and my Dean. I was told to ignore him, as he is mentally ill. I was told he is harmless and that I should laugh it off. I was told that nothing he did was really going to harm my professional development because I was so smart and capable of rising above. When I continued to demand an end to his contact with me, and secured a lawyer, the institution finally put in writing that he is not to be my department chair any  more, that he is to stop attending my class, that he is to have no contact with me, that he is not to address me. All this triggered his fury and his behavior became dangerous. He announced to students that he was divorcing me, and posted a sign on his door that because of my hostility towards him, and University invasiveness, that his liberties are being taken away. Students would laugh and joke about it in front of me. They would tease me to take him back because he was so brokenhearted. They reported he would take up regular class time describing his anger towards me as the divorce proceeded. He made regular derogatory comments about me and anything I contributed as an idea during faculty meetings. He wrote a private letter for my tenure file that was later described to me by members of the t & p committee as pages long, filled with hateful descriptions of my incompetence, and that ""couldn't have been crazier if it had been written in crayon."" Private letters were eliminated from tenure review processes shortly after this episode. The harassment lasted a total of six years, until he was took an early retirement option.  Some of my colleagues to this day who supported him are hostile to me for being so cruel to their ""kindly colleague"" who ""suffered from mental illness.""

2124,"I used to go to office hours for organic chemistry, because it's a critical class for premed and pre-phd.  I was often the only one there for part, if not all, of the allotted time.  He started making ""flirty"" comments, which is a weird way to put it because I was 18 and he was late 40s/early 50s.  Also it was't normal flirtation as I've ever experienced it.  For instance, I was taking art classes, including painting - he used to say he wanted to come watch me ""paint.""  He asked if I did nudes - he made it clear that he meant that I would be naked.  He tried to hug me, grab me, touch my thighs, body etc.  I pulled away and tried to laugh it off until it was too much and I left.  This happened many times, but I needed help - the exams were far more advanced than the lectures.  Anyway, this continued with him trying to push it further and further.  I finally told a fellow student study buddy, who was stunned... because the same guy had done the same thing to his girlfriend the previous year!  The next year, I was at a restaurant downtown and I was obliquely talking to a friend about what had happened... the bartender was stunned and interrupted our conversation.  A chemistry professor had come in one day and had told him all about how he seduced the students in his classes, and they were such easy pickings, and in fact he was there to meet one that night!  The bartender saw him skeeving on the young woman who came in (they left together), and he was super disturbed by the guy, the whole conversation and the scene.  He described the guy and also volunteered without prompting that the guy had a very prominent limp!  Just like the guy who had been harassing me.

1709,"I studied and started my PhD at an Austrian university. When I started, I did not know what would be the international standards to present doctoral thesis at international conferences etc. Me and other female PhD students were held back a lot, whereas a male and politically active PhD student who started later was pushed to present at these conferences right from the beginning. This was even harder as I and other female PhDs were buried with more administrational work than the male colleagues and my PhD supervisor started to use ideas from my thesis as his. I experienced this afterwards, too, that he would do this with his other female PhD students. He would work with us intensely and if some other male professor said something against it, he started to say he never knew what we were doing and that it's bad and irrelevant. These things piled up during the PhD and afterwards he would push the new head of the department into the same direction telling that I wouldn't do interesting stuff. This person then said that someone like me cannot work in such an exotic field and he took up some ideas himself - and told me, that he expected his PostDocs to kneel in front of him as he did 20 years ago. They tried hard to get me out of my contract and when I tried to go to higher instances at the university, some people started to mutter that this might come out of a former sexual relationship that I might have stopped. Such nonesense! In the end, I got no help, so I quit my position. There were quite a few more in a similar situation, 3 quit, others worked until they reached their habilitation without any help of their male supervisor, on the contrary, many of them tried to make this way as hard as possible for them. One thing I have to add that 20 women got this tenure position to push females in university position, but it seems that especially those had the hardest time. 4 years later the new head of the university gave an order to do a study on the problems, I was interviewed and all interviewers were shocked what happened to me and most other women in this cohort. But in the end, nothing happened and the study was not even made official.","PhD, then Assistant Professor","Phd, Then Assistant Professor",Doctoral supervisor; head of the department.,Various incidents with people of different genders,Other,Social Science;Economics,Research Institute,Graduate Student,Graduate Student, Social sciences
1279,"I was manipulated by a predatory reader/adviser for my dissertation into a sexual relationship.  My primary adviser, and hence first reader, was on family leave, so this second reader became the person I was dependent upon for guidance, mentorship, and affirmation of my work.  (also, my marriage was going downhill at the time, so I was pretty vulnerable)  This second reader invited me out for drinks on a weekly basis, began to ""dis"" my primary adviser and my third reader, and shared with me his marital problems and frustrations.  I was flattered that he thought ""highly"" enough of me to share these confidences and to be so honest with me - and as a clergy person, I was easily drawn in to his need to disclose and share his ""troubles.""  This ultimately led to a sexual relationship while at a conference in England - after my dissertation was turned in, but before my defense.  He could have waited to screw me until after the defense - the fact that he didn't demonstrates the power play involved.  I wound up utterly ""smitten"" (think Monica Lewinsky, here) and also became physically ill - developing ulcerative colitis.

1347,"When I was a first year graduate student, I started dating another student in my department who was a year ahead of me. The emotional abuse started early; assuming that I could not handle the problem sets on my own, he gave me all of his from the previous year. He constantly invalidated my feelings, suggesting each time I got upset that ""that's such a rich white girl thing to get upset over."" When I made comments during conversations, both one-on-one and in larger groups of physics grad students, he would frequently invalidate me, suggesting that I had seen nothing of the real world, and that I was nothing more than a wealthy sheltered child. 

Over time, he became increasingly controlling, and I feared retaliation when I wanted to end the relationship. I remained in that state for three and a half months. When I finally did, serious harassment ensued. He would drive by my house repeatedly, wait at the end of the bike path where he knew I liked to ride, and occasionally sit on my front steps and wait for me to get home at the end of the day. One day, he chased me out of the gym and screamed at me on the athletic quad. During departmental coffee hours and other social events, he would glare at me, shifting his position to maintain his line of sight. He texted me a death threat, and spread rumors in the department that I cheated on my problem sets and exams. He also circulated the rumor that I was only accepted into the program because of my gender identity, and that I only passed the first year because I am pretty. When I told my close friends about the harassment, many abandoned me, saying that it was my fault for breaking his heart. 

Since there were virtually no female faculty members in my department, and certainly none with whom I had ever conversed, I went to the administrative coordinator. She put me in touch with the Title IX office. The possible paths forward included an on campus no-contact order (which would not protect me in my off campus residence or neighborhood), or a full on restraining order. The Title IX office suggested that if I feared further retaliation, I should not press charges. I was extremely fearful of retaliation. For the remainder my my second year, I only went to campus to attend class. I would arrive five minutes late to the class that we were both enrolled in, and left five minutes early to avoid possible interaction. For the rest of the time, I worked from home. After year two, I left physics. ",Graduate student.,Graduate Student.,Graduate student in the same department.,Male,Male,Physics,Multiple,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,Natural sciences
