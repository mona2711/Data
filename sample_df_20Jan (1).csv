2,"The first time I met the (esteemed, tenured) professor I was supposed to spend my PhD years working, he caressed my hand when when shook hands, and then made me sit close to him on his couch instead of in a chair across from his desk. I had been warned that he ""likes French women."" Over the past couple of years, I have seen him touch women without their consent on multiple occasions. He obviously gets a kick out of toeing the line between ""vaguely inappropriate"" and downright unacceptable. I have since changed my entire study focus in order to avoid working with him. Half of the department ignores his behavior or says he's ""just an old man,"" and the other half won't rally against him in fear of what he could do to our careers.",Humanities,Regional College,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,136

4,"I was stroked / tested with unwanted touch on the thigh and threatened ""with war"" and with the wrath of professors I admired by a full (yet strangely underqualified) professor when I questioned a timeline for a project. I was taken aback as I had not experienced being touched to demonstrate power and contempt before. I had just explained that I could not do a last minute / haphazard assignment because needed to go to a memorial service after a year of deaths in my family (in retrospect I was also clearly reeling after an emotionally difficult year and after leaving family and my partner). I was new to the country and the department, knew almost no one in the time zone, and was operating all but entirely without a support network in a program that had comps in the first quarter of the first year. He verbally threatened me and suggested the new chair (whom I admired) would have problems with me and I should not be on her bad side--another threat. Indeed, after whatever he communicated to her she did not speak to me for more than six months and described him as her friend several times. I heard informally I was being 'trashed' by the associated personnel. I was a first year PhD student. I later heard my project, which moved outside university facilities, became infamous though I actually did it in order to be far away from him and from his colleagues. The rumor mill on that was also out of proportion, all within a male in crowd, and intentionally damaging to me. To my eternal appreciation, two male colleagues did defend me some years later and I began to talk fairly openly about it after graduation--that helped me heal and feel I had credibility again.",Humanities,Elite Institution,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,300
5,"A group of male students wrote very sexually explicit course evaluations about me (specially about my body parts). There were about 4-5 of them in the same class that were on the same theme so it was likely a coordinated effort by the students. I told the senior people at the university what happened but I didn't make a formal report (I did not know that was a possibility). A dean said, ""if she dresses like that, what does she expect"" to a group of my colleagues, who reported it back to me.

6,"Three different incidents in three different Canadian universities as I worked towards my doctorate in Englisht Language and Literature.  The first involved several approaches by a professor to join his ""groupies"" to share wine and literary discussion.  I believe one or more of my peers became his paramour and I was a distinct outsider for not joining in.  Their marks were quite high!
The second was more serious and involved being stalked by a professor in the department who made several attempts to get in to my apartment accompanied by compliments and then pleas to pursue a relationship and which was only stopped by threats of exposure by my fellow student and myself. Interestingly, while he was not one of my profs, his best friend gave me the lowest mark in the class (all my other marks were in the ""A"" range.)
The third incident may have cost me a position as an assistant professor when I  rejected the advances  of one of the professors on the hiring committee who had invited me into his office after the interview.   This included removing his hand from my knee.",Humanities,Multiple,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,192
7,"Sexual harassment from a senior graduate student who was supposed to mentor/train me. He pressured me to have a sexual relationship with him. This pressure continued for months despite my repeated declarations that I was not interested. Unfortunately, despite my best judgment, I eventually gave in and started dating him. It quickly became evident that this was not a relationship that would work for me. He was emotionally abusive and unbearably narcissistic. I tried to break it off with him multiple times, but each time he made life at work a living hell, and eventually I would succumb to his advances just to quell the non-stop barrage of verbal and emotional abuse (although obviously it was still abuse to be coerced into a relationship like this). When I finally ended it for the last time, he of course made my life a living hell again at work...as I had feared. This was a problem because he was specializing in an analytical technique I needed for my research project and he was supposed to be mentoring me for that component of my research. But it wasn't just that he refused to help me. He took it a step further and was a cruel bully to me in the workplace. For example, he regularly told me I wasn't smart enough for the program. Any time I had a question, any time I made a small mistake, sometimes out of the blue for no reason at all. He would remind me of my inferiority. He even went as far as to spread horrible rumors about me to other graduate students in our program. Some of the rumors were sexual in nature. Others were about my ""incompetence"" in our field. These rumors socially isolated me from the rest of the group. ",Applied science,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,298
8,"My good friend was a physics major at a state university in California which was quite rare in the 1980's. She was doing undergrad research in the lab of the Physics chair. Chair began touching my friend casually from the day she started working in his lab. He spent more and more time in the lab that coincided with her hours.  Within a couple of months, Chair was physically trapping my friend behind lab benches and in corners. He continually made sexually suggestive comments to her. The touching advanced to 'accidental' brushes against her breasts and laying his hand on her behind. I encouraged my friend to go to the dean of physical sciences. She did. Thus began a humiliating experience with the male dean insisting that she bring in witnesses to the abuse. She did. Every one of the other students and the lab assistant were male. They witnessed many of these incidents and never interceded. Still, they did support her claims that Chair did single out my friend and most had seen him touch her inappropriately. The dean had no choice but to discipline Chair and the decision was to remove him as chair of the physics department. The dean told my friend she should avoid Chair. She had already withdrawn from working in the lab. In fact, there was no way for her to avoid Chair since he taught all of the upper level courses she needed to complete her degree. My friend changed her major to accounting and shut the door on her love of physical science. Because a man insisted on viewing a female student as a sex object, we lost a budding female physicist. We still talk about what could have been. My friend carries a great sadness.",Natural sciences,Other Type of School,Male,Graduate Student,Chair/Dean/Head,295
9,"I've been harassed and propositioned by both female and male colleagues. I've continually witnessed how senior male academics treat their junior and female colleagues, both in their objectification and in 'mansplaining' to them. I've seen women in academia change institutions to get away from the male dominance of power; which in some instances involved changing into disciplines that are more female-driven. I had to put in two separate and formal sexual harassment claims within my first two years at the same institution. I've seen male academics respect the mind of a female academic, but who have disrespectfully in turn attempted to desire her body as well. I've heard/seen countless tales of supervisor-student affairs, predominately when the supervisor is male and the student female.

10,"My professor asked me to have sex with him while we were alone and working on processing tissue on a Saturday. This proposition followed months of him taking me out for coffee under the guise of mentor ship, where he increasingly positioned himself on a pedestal relative to me, and tossed in questions about my sexual preferences and past in the context of a burgeoning friendship. He was in an unhappy marriage, didn't have many friends, and described his personal life with her at length to me.  I answered his questions by carefully skirting around them and re-directing the conversation to neutral ground: he didn't seem bothered by my lack of engagement in any of it, and seemed relieved for an opportunity to share his thoughts and feelings freely (he should have just gone to therapy). When I rejected the proposition to have sex with him (which shocked me) I stammered that I wasn't comfortable mixing business and pleasure. He became defensive and embarrassed. I attempted to play it off, and in the moment, believed that I had done so, and left the incident behind me. 

Two weeks later we met in his office to go over the things I needed to begin my next set of experiments. He closed the door and told me I didn't deserve any of it, had an arrogant and entitled approach to science, and that unless I mended our relationship, would never have a future in science since he held all power over my future. Further, he reneged on a previously arranged agreement to allow me flexibility to TA for additional semesters to make my financial ends meet. He forbid me to find external employment, and told me just to deal with it - knowing I was under financial duress. 

I reported it to my department head, who made a note in a file, and asked me if I wanted to switch labs. I was asked if he touched me, if I had any proof of explicit messages, or if anyone had borne witness. Of course, I had none of these things. Since this was the only lab in the entire school doing the kind of work I was interested in, I stuck it out. My supervisor didn't speak to me for an entire year, and I completed the remainder of my experiments alone. ",Applied science,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,392

He also announced to the class that he would steal parts of our writing for his own. When he submitted said work to the class for review, the professor did nothing. After I told the professor he was harassing me (one month into my first semester), I was told that he likely wouldn't be anything more than an annoyance, but encouraged to come forward if things escalated. Over semester break, he bullied the other two classmates online, repeatedly cornering one of them in person, and transferred into the only class we were all in when he found out that we weren't going to be in class together. I notified faculty again, this time including the chair of the department, and they told me to contact the Office of Student Conduct, after which I got a no-contact ruling (so my classmate couldn't contact me in any way, even through an intermediary). My other classmates also reported him, but only anonymously. The following semester, that ruling was stayed because we had to have class together. He contacted me again less than a year later. When I told the faculty, they said they couldn't do anything because any complaint had to go through the Office of Student Conduct. It felt like a complete lack of engagement with the problem.

16,"2007, my academic advisor, in a closed door meeting, sat on the edge of his desk, invaded my personal space, and grabbed my ankle. He then said I was very pretty and asked if I wanted to take off my clothes. I refused and told him he was making me uncomfortable. He shrugged and tried to kiss me and when I pulled away, he laughed and sat back in his chair. He then started to justify he proposition saying he’s done things with students in the past and when I expressed disappointment for disrespecting his marriage and my relationship status he said that he and his wife have an understanding. I repeated that I wasn’t interested and left his office. He later sent me apologetic emails which I deleted, feeling ashamed and confused. I obsessed about whether I had lead him on or talked about inappropriate things that made him think I was receptive. I told a friend, who told me I was over reacting. I constantly wondered if the A I had received in his class was due to the fact that he wanted to sleep with me and not my developing skill in the subject. Aware of his tenured status in the department, I decided the following semester to change my major and never took another class in his department. Of note, two years later, that same friend who dismissed my concerns, was propositioned by the same professor and finally validated my experience. She and another student who had had similar experiences (being cornered and asked for sexual activity by this professor) went to a female professor in the department and with her guidance, the three of us reported our experiences to the Dean of the college. We were made to recount the experiences and told that they would take it from there.

A senior faculty member, who was rumored to have been inappropriate in his advances to students, approached multiple students of mine. He would approach young female undergrads and offer them research opportunities with him in Europe. Essentially, he was asking 19 year-old-girls if they wanted to go to Croatia with him, to be his research assistant. This happened multiple times, over multiple semesters. I asked my department chair for advice, because very excited students would rush in to talk to me about it, he told me to walk those girls into his office.

18,"Gang stalked and harassed by faculty members after I was no longer a student. A male faculty who works with the Veteran students at CCBC made me aware that his wife no longer has sex with him. Each time I had to register for classes, he would take me aside and ask deep personal questions about my life. He told me that he had sexual dreams about me. He made sure that my file was always hidden on his desk. No one else could touch my file. They couldn't even find it. It was normal procedure for me to be forced to wait there for up to 2 hours while they fiddled around looking for my file, called my professors to make sure I could take the class, emailed them and insisted I wait for an email response, and whatever else they were doing. I always had permission to be in the class from the professors and the VA doesn't care what classes I take, so long as this is an accreditted college. So because the admin person was sexually harassing me, I was also forced to endure mistreatment based on my protective status as a veteran. After everything was filled out, this sexual harasser would then insist on sitting down and reviewing my entire career at the school, claiming he could not read his writing. When I complained to the head of the VA, he insisted angrily that the sexual harasser worked in the finance office. That he does but he also represented the Veterans at the school. The head of the VA department for CCBC did not care that I was being sexually harassed or that I was forced to wait 2 hours at the Veterans desk at the finance office. He wasn't listening and was instead angry that I refused to go to his frat party where alcohol was served. He then insisted that I was mentally ill for using the adult words, ""CYA"" and ""BS."" What I meant was that these people refused to allow me to leave their office until they had covered their butts that the class was paid for and that I would not sue CCBC if I took an elective for fun that I wanted, seeing as I already have a degree and the classes I took with them were just for fun. And it is totally BS that they would force me to stand there and wait in their office for hours while they track down professors who have a life. I said nothing wrong but this abusive faculty member told me I was insane and that he was calling the behavioral health department to punish me for speaking  up to him about the sexual abuse, harassment I had received at CCBC. I had already told him that I had quit the campus a week before. Needless to say the abusive woman at the behavioral health department called me on my cell despite the fact that she had in writing that I was no longer a studdent, and she left a voicemail telling me she would recommend me mental  health treatments. I called her back and asked her to quit stalking me since she knew I was not a student and she had no legal right to call me and because I had done nothing wrong.

He spent that time walking around in his underwear and drinking.  A few times when we were taking group pictures, he would put his hand on my butt and squeeze, but there was no way to tell him to stop without making a scene in front of everyone, including other professors.

Then, both of us felt really guilty about labeling him a creep, and both decided to give him another chance. At another location, he asked me to come with him to get some food and wine from his cabin to bring back for the rest of the class, and while we were getting it, he started rubbing my shoulders, and I made an excuse to go.

A former colleague who was a serial flirt caused drama in my department for years. He engaged in behaviors that most women would interpret as being hit on: flattering appearance, dropping by the office to chat for no reason and asking personal (but not too personal) questions, even touching that was not clearly sexual but beyond what one usually encounters in a professional setting – a shoulder or a wrist. That is as far as it progressed with me; I don’t know if it went further with others. When I mentioned it to a female colleague she told me that this man was a “terrible flirt” and cautioned me not to take him seriously. She told me about a woman had taken him seriously and had been badly embarrassed when her crush on him became the subject of office gossip, while the man acted befuddled and made sure everyone understood the crush was unrequited and that it was she who pursued him, not the reverse. The woman was no longer in the department when I arrived. I don’t know her and don’t know if the incident affected her departure. But over the next few years, I observed the man following the same pattern with new hires who were pretty young women. Others observed as well and gossiped about it, but the gossip always put the woman in a bad light while sparing the man. People would speculate about a woman’s interest in the man, often in unflattering ways that approached slut-shaming or implied she was pathetic for not realizing this was just what he did. To my knowledge, no one ever told him to stop, but I know that on at least one occasion he was told that some women considered him flirtatious. He feigned ignorance and innocence and protested that everyone knew he was married. And then the behavior continued, for years. I doubt I am the only one who felt it was problematic but it was hard to pin down. After all, many women are attracted to men. But I don’t think his behavior was irrelevant and I don’t think it was innocent. Too many women were subjected to ugly gossip and workplace distraction while the man got a pass for toying with people and causing drama.

40,"In fall 1971, my sophomore year, I enrolled in a class taught by an African American male faculty member who had a reputation for sexually harassing female students. As I was  African American and his previous targets had all been white, I assumed I was safe. Around midterm, he insisted I was too advanced for the topic he’d assigned most of the class for a final paper and would need to meet with him in private to devise a topic for me. I knew that “private meetings” with him had been occasions for various forms of browbeating and manipulation for other women. Thus, I spent the remainder of the semester insisting I was too busy to meet with him and begging for a paper topic. Finally, realizing that if I failed to write a paper because I had no assigned topic I could be flunked, I explained my dilemma to another (legitimately) advanced student and asked her to share her topic with me, adding I would do my own research and inevitably produce results different from her own so there should be no question of plagiarism. She agreed. I thoroughly researched and carefully wrote my paper, vowing not to complain as long as the professor gave me a grade of B or above. Less than that and I felt confident my complaint would be taken seriously by the committee on faculty conduct, as I was a well-known, well-liked student with an excellent academic record who was also one of the leaders of the campus black student organization. The professor had been brought up on sexual harassment charges the previous year, but managed to elude censure by painting himself a victim of racism—a claim that would be much harder to make in my case. I received a B for the course, so felt no need to take matters further. The following semester, however, the professor flagged me down one day in the Student Union. He was seated with the girl who’d shared her topic with me and her boyfriend, another of the prof’s advanced students. The prof proceeded to inform me he’d been so impressed by my term paper that he wanted to meet with me to discuss the possibility of collaborating on its publication. At that point, I loudly informed him I was no longer his student, told him exactly what I thought of him and marched off.",Humanities,Regional College,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,399

He would be charming at first and then ridiculously controlling. I could write pages regarding his bad behavior and how stressed and upsetting he would make our female students. His behavior got worse as he progressed through the program. Yet faculty still wrote recommendation letters for him. He got a job as a tenure track faculty member and his behavior didn’t change there. He went on to ‘date’ numerous female undergrads and grads in his department. Till he got so obsessed with one student he ‘dated’ that he stalked and harassed her when she broke it off. Without revealing names, he eventually got fired by his university.

One night after I had a few pints he approached me at the pub when friends were leaving and tried to walk me home. I, fortunately, was escorted home by my friends.

44,"As a young assistant professor at an art school I noticed an older adjunct faculty member who would lurk in the halls or appear out of nowhere and stare. Other colleagues agreed he was ""creepy."" Fast forward 10 years. I was now department chair and it came to my attention that this same guy, who taught poetry writing, was making female undergraduates pretty uncomfortable. Rather than teaching everyone together in a classroom, he held tutorials in his tiny office with the door closed so that he could work with each individual student on her writing. One student came forward when she received an envelope of poems at her home address (which she had not shared with him -- he had gotten the registrar to tell him where she lived). Although he would deny it, the poems were highly suggestive and personal, mentioning, for example, a tattoo on her leg and the street she lived on. He also called her on her cell phone and asked her questions about her boyfriend. He would have students bring some of their art to class so he could help them translate their inspiration into words; in her case he honed in on a photograph in which she appeared in the background, in the shadows, partly nude. (This was in that tiny office with the door closed.) The student filed a complaint, and I had her taken out of the class and asked another colleague to work with her through the rest of the semester so that she could get credit for the course. This was just the first incident. This student filed a complaint which was adjudicated through a complex system that included both the in-house sexual harassment procedure and the state-wide faculty union grievance process. His defense was that he was working very hard with each student to draw out their creative energy based on what he saw in their work, and of course, they explored all kinds of subjects in their work. The fact that they were 20 years old and he was somewhere in his 70s, supposedly mature enough to know where to draw the line, did not seem to register. He had several advocates in the department, all male and quite senior to me, who argued that his writing poems for the students was a matter of free speech, and that stopping it would cast a shadow over the principles of artistic freedom at the school. The poet was able to keep his job with a stern warning, an order not to have students in his office alone, and a remedial sexual harassment training program -- something required by state law that had not really been enforced for adjunct faculty, putting the university in a position of potential liability. He came to my office in the fall and told me he was very sorry, he now understood, and I would never have any trouble with him again. I told him I hoped he meant it. But of course he kept up the same behavior, choosing new students for his obsession each term. After the students saw that he had not been fired, they were very reluctant to bring new complaints against him, and feeling very upset that I had not been able to get justice for the first student, I did not feel I could push them to complain, as I could make no promises. I could only take the incident to the civil rights officer, but without a formal complaint we could go no further. Every time I went to him and told him I knew what he was up to, he wanted to know who complained, and whined about how he had a constitutional right to face his accuser. He denied and denied, and begged me not to take away the only meaningful thing left in his life. After a couple of these incidents he seems to have understood he couldn't do this with students in his class, but decided it would be ok to stalk random students he saw in the halls. Two years after my term was up, he turned his attention to a graduate student, followed her to the cafeteria, invited himself to have lunch with her, offered to help her with recommendations, etc. She didn't like it but she felt she had to be polite to a professor. Then he wrote a little play and e-mailed it to her. There was immediately a second e-mail saying ""maybe you shouldn't open that other e-mail but just delete it."" Naturally she opened it. It was very explicit. She brought it to public safety, who called HR, and at last he was escorted out of the building and banned from campus.

He admitted to having been sympathetic to red pill attitudes, having abused his girlfriend, and having wanted to physically attack a previous female roommate after a fight over laundry. I lived with him and one other roommate. Two nights after my third roommate moved out, we went to a dinner at some friends. When we returned he expressed interest in me. I turned him down but he proceeded to argue with me for two hours about my reasons for turning him down. I did think it was strange that the time he'd choose to make his interest known was when there was no one else in the department and I was drunk, but I chalked it up to bad decision-making. Two weeks later we were at a bar and he kept buying my shots because I was celebrating an academic success with our colleagues. When we got home he again propositioned me again and argued with me for more than an hour instead of accepting my answer. He also physically blocked me from leaving my seat during this until I begged to go to the bathroom. Once I got away I barricaded myself in my room, since my door didn't have a lock. Several nights later I awoke to seeing him standing outside of my door looking in at me. I confessed what happened to a female colleague and she told me he had hit on her when she first got to campus. I heard a similar story from a third female colleague. 

I felt these incidents were likely to continue and escalate and sought recourse from the faculty to prevent that from happening. I also thought I had an obligation as an employee of the institution to report sexual harassment, but apparently there is a loophole where you can decline to report sexual harassment directed towards yourself. I was unaware of this. A female colleague was supposed to replace me in the house and she was good friends with him, so I didn't think she would listen if I tried to warn her. I thought the best way to protect her, other female colleagues, and the undergraduates that he supervised as a teaching assistant was to report the situation to the Dean of my department.

The response of the institution - a female chair at the time- was cliche. ""Oh that's just how he is and we can't legislate love"".  LOVE??

He said he was planning to stay late and agreed to walk me to my bike. These are my notes from the incident: 

I finished reading a little after 10pm and as I started packing up * sparked up a conversation about his loneliness and his relationship status. He confessed that he was reading a self-help book about relationships because he felt really lonely and couldn’t figure out how to meet someone. He mentioned that in the book he was reading the author said that women immediately knew whether or not they would sleep with a man upon meeting him. He then proceeded to ask me about my relationships. He asked me if I had ever had a one night stand and I said no. He said he couldn’t believe it and said that he had slept with a lot of virgins—that these young women would pick him out, in a club, for example, and ask to sleep with him. I told him I found it odd and unbelievable. I can’t recall the exact details of the conversation at this point, but I do know that as he continued to ask me about my relationships and the role that sex played in my relationships.

At one point * suddenly asked me “Do you want to fuck?” 
I said “No, I would never sleep with you.” 
He said “Well, when I look at you I want to fuck you. When you look at me do you want to fuck me?”
I repeated myself, “No, I would never sleep with you.”
He acted shocked. 
He told me something along the lines of “I can fuck for hours.” 
He also told me that his room was nearby. 
I told him “You’re being really creepy ***,” because by this point the entire tone of the conversation had changed dramatically, and I was startled and afraid.  Although he denied that he was acting creepy, I repeated myself. I called his behavior creepy at least 4 times and he asked me to stop saying it. He said something like “That’s the kind of thing you say about criminals” (he might have said “…about a molester” I can’t remember exactly). He was visibly upset by my comment.

As I was sitting down printing, *** positioned himself standing behind me and asked me “What kind of panties are you wearing?” 
I told him to stop, and that he was really creeping me out. 

I was really afraid that I was alone with him and I would have to walk outside to get my bike and that he might hurt me. In an effort to direct the conversation, once again, toward his inappropriate behavior, I started a conversation about how he related to woman in the history department. I told him that I thought he had problems communicating with women and that other women in the department had mentioned as much. I told him that a couple of women had complained to me that he didn’t acknowledge them or say hello, and that in this instance, when he was actually talking to one of his female colleagues, his behavior had become inappropriate very quickly. He got defensive again and told me that he always tried to be very objective and that he wanted people to think of him as such, and that perhaps he was misunderstood. I told him that, on the contrary, he wasn’t objective at all; that he was one of the most dogmatic people I knew and that other people in the department might agree with me. At this point we were walking outside and I had already picked up my bike. He told me that the reason he didn’t acknowledge women or even say hello to them was because his aunt had told him that, as a man, any little thing you do—even looking at a woman the wrong way—might be misinterpreted as sexual harassment.

That same PI proceeded to make a lot of comments to be about how hard field work is for a woman, how hard it is for women to use the bathroom outside, etc. At our field site, before dinner but after our day of work, I went for a run. When I got back the others were eating so I joined them. The PI then said to me, ""You shouldn't be in running shorts around professors."" (One of the professors was also wearing shorts-- that prof actually came up and apologized to me because he was embarrassed about the PI's behavior). He made me change into pants. A few days later, I was with the woman postdoc and one of the other French scientists. We found an amazing sample and the French man said, ""Wow! This sample should be help by a woman in a calendar of naked women!"" I was shocked/offended that that was what he chose to say to describe the excitement of the find. These are just some examples of what that trip was like.",Natural sciences,Multiple,Other,Graduate Student,Faculty,241
73,"I was taking a summer course as an undergrad (summer 2000), and had found I liked to come to professors' office hours (how fitting that I ended up getting my PhD eventually)! I went to see my lit professor that summer in his office, to discuss a poem I didn't understand. He kept getting closer to me during the meeting, till he was sitting next to me on the sofa in his office, with his hand on my leg, then up my skirt. I was very naive, but also realized he shouldn't be touching me. I told him I was late for another appointment and bolted. ",Humanities,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,107
74,"This prominent history professor had started to take me under his wing and we would meet frequently to talk about my research ideas. There was a barely noticeable sexual vibe during our meetings, so I just brushed it off. I was just starting my PhD program and getting the support from this man meant a whole lot. One time we met to discuss my summer research plans and I told him I needed to get funding. He proceeded to ask how much money I needed and offered to pay for it. I was completely shocked and confused, not knowing how to respond. A red flag went off in the back of my mind because I felt that accepting his personal money would move the relationship in a more personal direction. I quickly thanked him but said that there was no need because I was applying for department funding. Something told me to stay away from this man and I eventually changed my research topic (not necessarily directly related to this). I always felt weird about this incident and there was no one I could process it with. Was I just really lucky? Should I have taken the money? Was he just that vested in my research? Would his wife (also a prominent professor on campus) know about this? Would it be a gift coming from both of them? I haven't processed this with any of my grad program friends because they all work with this man and they all see him as an academic father figure. Its a small weird episode, but I share it because this man is a powerful force at my institution and this is the only place where I feel safe sharing it.

75,"When I was a Junior in undergrad (2006), I was in a physics writing class with about 10+ male classmates and one other female classmate.  The professor wanted to make a point about electrons not being able to occupy the same state and invited me to come sit on his knees in front of the whole class (which is obviously very unnecessary for making said point).  I looked like a deer caught in the headlights and he insisted again, saying he ""wouldn't bite"" or some such nonsense.  I proceeded over to him and sat at the very edge of his knees, mortified, as all of my classmates watched him bounce me on his knees.  I told my father about the incident and he suggested I not report it because it would ""create more trouble than it's worth"".  ",Natural sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,143
76,"Friendliness mistaken for romantic interest by older male senior colleague with whom I was collaborating.  He was respectful of my saying no; however our collaboration fell apart.

Keynote speaker seeks me out after his talk.  Wants to take me for a drink. Comments on my ass.

77,"I was in my second semester of a 4 semester program (2 academic yrs) in an engineering lab run by the lecture instructor. I was holding a heavy piece of laboratory equipment with both hands when the lecture instructor walked over to me and poked me in the stomach and asked if I was ticklish. I asked, ""Excuse me?"" and he repeated the action and the question. Another female classmate stood by watching with her mouth open stunned into speechlessness and asked if I was okay after. I had classes and labs led by this instructor all four semesters of that program before I transferred to another institution to finish my Bachelor of Science in Engineering.",Applied science,Other Type of School,Male,Undergraduate Student,Faculty,116
78,"First term of my undergrad degree, I signed up for an extra-curricular project run by a senior lecturer in my department. In the first session, I noticed he was looking down my top during the whole time he was presenting but brushed it off. 
However, within a couple of months of being on the project, he would try and greet me physically after a few months of working together by hugging me and kissing me on the cheeks, which I tried to avoid but often couldn't. Another time, I ran into him at the train station, where he complimented me on my physical appearance (I was dressed up) and proceeded to sit down next to me on the bench and get as close as he possibly could, while talking as in my face as possibleWhen he emailed me about the project we were working on, he detailed his physical exercise routine and that he had been swimming daily over the summer, as if I was interested? And whether I had had an exciting summer?' . I lessened my involvement in the project so I would avoid being around him - even on campus, he would make a beeline for me, often ignoring my female friend who also worked on the project, so it made it even more obvious he had a thing for me.

79,"I was on an annual geology 'field camp' related to my major.  My class (10 men, 3 women) traveled through Colorado working in different areas of geologic interest - like a 6 week hands on lab.  I consistently received bad scores on my weekly labs, insulting comments from one particular professor. One included ""did you even do this work?"" on a very extensive lab (yes, i had). Turns out that the professor expected at least one of the women in field camp each year to sleep with him for the duration (6 weeks) of the course.  It just didn't happen to be me, so i guess i warranted a bad final grade from him. Lucky for me the other professors gave me great scores, in hindsight I'm sure this was a regular occurrence for this course so they passed me in their sections. I DID graduate.
