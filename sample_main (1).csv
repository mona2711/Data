0,"My advising professor asked me to sleep with him, and when I said no, he quietly retreated from his adviser roll. I had no backup as he was the last of the discipline in the department. His behavior was well known: he had an open string of girlfriends drawn from the graduate pool over the years. He had one when he hit on me. Presumably she was wowed by trips to France and fine wine. But his contempt for women was obvious. By that time he was in his 60s. I took my qualifying exams and left the institution to scratch out a study site on my own to complete my dissertation. I fought hard - without meaningful letters of recommendation - for a career in academia. Even still, 20 years later, I do not have a network of invested academics 'who raised me'. The response of the institution - a female chair at the time- was cliche. ""Oh that's just how he is and we can't legislate love"".  LOVE?? 
It easily set my career back 10 years, but I guess, after having read so many stories of women ""hounded out"" (excellent terms, btw), I should consider myself ""one of the lucky ones"". At that time in the late 80s and early 90s, several women were harassed in the short time I was there.

1,"In my final few months of graduate school, my dissertation chair invited me to his hotel room while we were at a conference to talk about my work... moments into our ""discussion"" I found that he was taking his pants off and wanted sexual intercourse. I feared that he would no longer support me if I went against his wishes. At the same time, I worried that people I respected, including my committee members, would denigrate me and my work if it were known that I had had sexual intercourse with him. I took on the situation as my own psychologically, and continue to suffer deep emotional trauma from this experience. I later ended up working with this same professor post-graduation on a major research project, and while I had made clear that I was not interested in any sexual relationship with him, he proceeded to engage in aggressive sexual harassment and sexual assault in his role as my supervisor. Once I settled into the job, he began to routinely grope me at work. He put his hands on my breast or genitals whenever he could manage it. He regularly commented on my body, shape, size, and sex appeal. He has verbally and physically threatened to rape me on several occasions. At each meeting with him, I anticipate I will be subject to some sort of sexual abuse or public ridicule because of my gender, but he is my supervisor, letter writer, and a giant in my field. This harassment is on-going and while I want to file a complaint with my university, I have been told by many colleagues and other women he has abused that the university does not care about me/us; it will always protects its cherished professors. And I have watched closely as other complaints of sexual harassment and assault are poorly handled by my university and how each time the accuser lost and the accused, often a professor, was unharmed.

I don't know how much these lopsided power relations were consensual but I have always felt uncomfortable that I remained silent. Only much later did I realize how widespread this kind of behavior was by him as well as by several other male faculty in the departments he visited (at both institutions). It's clear that his sexual come-ons to his students were part of a pattern of harassment that both departments/universities tolerated. Male students, even the lackluster ones, were mentored by him. Meanwhile, almost all the female students, especially the smartest ones, he tried (often successfully) to have sex with. This division of attentions permeated interactions well beyond his specific 'affairs' but he was not the only faculty member in those departments to abuse trust and practice inegalitarian treatment of their students.",I was a grad student taking classes from him.,I was a grad student taking classes from him.,He was my professor.,Male,Male,German,Elite Institution,Graduate Student,Faculty,Humanities,159,

45,"about 6 months ago, a cis-man who was my mentor in my undergraduate degree explicitly hit on me via Facebook messenger. I'm now a Ph.D. student at the school he attended. We share similar speech/debate/academic circles. He was my mentor -- he wrote me a glowing letter of recommendation to two of my universities. He's married and I have discouraged him from these types of highly charged messages. I have sought to redirect his amorous attention back to his marriage. I would like to preserve this mentorship/friendship, and have tried to be empathetic to circumstances which might be leading him to seek out sexual fulfillment in me. However, this has really damaged my view of him and has negatively impacted me. I've started to wonder if I he wrote my letters of recommendation because he was sexually attracted to me and does this mean I'm not fit for academic work? 

Another incident mirrored this when I was a student on a competitive speech team at the same age when I was my mentor's student. I received explicit messages from my married coach about how ""sexy"" and ""pretty"" and ""hot"" I was. ""What would you think of me doing X to your body"".

55,"my freshman year at a private liberal-arts research university on the east coast.
#1: Fall semester: first guy invited me to a meeting in his office (we all had them) which he scheduled late in the day after most everyone had gone home. He required me to produce 6 drawings of myself naked. When I returned with the assigned work, he commented as much on my body as on my artistic skills. I tried to avoid one-on-one contact with him and, to counter gossip in dorm and class, I pretended the assignments were edgy, avant-garde experiments that I chose myself. I had to insist all the time I didn't have a crush on him. UGH! How could one improve if one couldn't work closely with the professor. Fortunately the work for that course was done outside the studio so I could limit my contact, if not stem the loss of the artistic skills a more noble man might have helped me develop.
#2: Spring semester: Second guy haunted the studio at night and on weekends when students were required to work there. He badgered us if we did not turn up nightly and accused us of not being serious artists. Over vacation, he invited himself to my empty dorm for dinner, expecting me to cook for him though I managed somehow to avoid his not-so-subtle advances. He kept asking inappropriate questions about my sexual experiences and insisted all inexperienced girls should have sex with a very experienced older man, etc. I hated being in the studio after hours and took an incomplete.
