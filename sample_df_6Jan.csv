I ended up participating in a mixed work and service trip led by this professor because it was in my area of professional interest and I was very eager for the experience.  There, in conversation with this professor about how I could improve, he said that what was wrong with me is that I had no vices and encouraged me to attend after-hours social events with other students.  I did, and the professor would approach me and whisper to me, out of earshot of others, things like, ""Are you turned on right now?"" and ""I bet you're turned on under those clothes.""  I consistently shut it down over a series of nights out.

I was sat on his couch and told how “us girls” would be taken care of. He proceeded to place he arm across my shoulders and lean into my body. Told me that I didn’t have to worry, that it would all work out. I gave clear signals and kept moving away. Months later after my PhD scholarship was approved (at university level as I was top graduate for my year), I was invited to coffee on campus by my boss and colleague of my PhD supervisor and the director of the dept. and told that I dressed provactively: that my doing so “won’t work” with my supervisor as he is gay. I was told that I need to stop using my femininity to get places: it worked in the past, but won’t work now. Told to stop smiling so much and not to flirt. She went on to discuss my sexual behaviour tactics and how I could adjust them to be “more professional”. Although this meeting could be construed as more of a sexual discrimination act, it was part of a dept wide approach to females. Too many incidents to list.

6,939,"As a PhD student, I found myself mired in icky ambiguously sexual circumstances with 2 different professors. The least awful was a professor who held his final seminar session in a bar over pitchers of beer & then invited me to for a bite to eat afterward. I hoped we were going to talk about my project &  thought surely he meant we'd grab a burger or some quick Thai food. But then he walked me into an expensive white table cloth restaurant and proceeded to order appetizers and wine and all these things he surely knew I could not afford. So reluctantly and awkwardly I let him pay, which made me feel crazy. After, he casually said let's go to my place to finish talking about your paper & I really really really wanted to go home but didn't know how to say that and felt so strange about having been treated to such an expensive meal. It sounds insane but I couldn't figure out how to get out of this night with him. It was all so confusing b/c in class he talked all the time about his kids and wife (""my wife"" and never by name. She was a fairly visible feminist & in hind sight, I see that he leveraged her feminism all the time to position himself as a feminist. UGH.) Anyway, I felt terribly embarrassed to be taking this as a date when he had made himself out to be such a family man & felt confused about how to extract myself, especially because I was still hoping for help in publishing the essay I had written for his seminar and that I cared so passionately about. That was icky but it was only 1 seminar and 1 grade at stake. More shattering was the next year when I was promoted from graduate teaching assistant to the prized fellowship everyone wanted - assistant editor to a very prestigious journal. The editor, my boss and a leading feminist, was both gate-keeper in my field and now boss of my graduate fellowship. She held in hand, then, both my immediate daily survival and the keys to my future, a future I had leveraged with considerable student loans. Although my fellowship contract obligated me to provide 20 hours a week of editing work, my boss expanded the duties to include coordinating dry cleaning, car repairs, credit card disputes, out-out-town fee-based speaking engagements and travel plans, etc. I wasn't allowed to go home for winter break b/c it was time to copy edit the galleys. This makes no sense b/c the journal was published in Baltimore by Johns Hopkins & we were editing on the west coast. So what did it matter where I finished the galleys? My boss never looked at the articles after the initial content editing was done anyway so it's not like we needed to collaborate. What I'm trying to explain is how I felt a little imprisoned, almost indentured. Sexual harassment was the cherry on top of this toxic covenant. I felt uncomfortable all the time & started wearing baggy clothing, which my boss hated. One time in front of my peers, she mocked the overalls I was wearing, exclaiming, ""I can fit a fist in your pants"" and then proceeded to shove not 1 but 2 fists into my crouch, right there in front of everyone. Another time at a conference, after I had just presented my paper and people were swarming to congratulate and ask me questions, she interrupted everything to spank me, right there in front of my peers and prospective future employers. I was mortified and I swear my brain stayed frozen for many days after that incident. I was so stuck and had sacrificed everything for this opportunity to study so I thought I had to accept the behavior. I thought I was managing but was so surprised each morning to discover that my pillow was wet. I lived in a crappy apartment so naturally I looked for a ceiling leak that might be the source of the wet pillow. Honestly, I really thought it was caused by an environmental leak until I finally realized my pillow was soggy from the salt tears I had been weeping in my sleep. I guess my conscious hours were so completely indentured that the only time I could cry was during sleep. I was trapped in a viciously competitive environment and so we students carefully guarded our secrets from each other. (Tragically, then, we didn't support each other or warn one other of possible hazards.) For this reason, I suspect but can not confirm that at least 2 other women in my program also may have experienced sexual coercion and harassment. One of them may have been in an even more precarious position than me b/c she was on a student visa and needed this professor's support to maintain her visa status.  
I completed my degree because I’m not a “quitter.” But I never asked for a letter of recommendation and I never once checked to see what jobs might be available in my field. All I could do was flee the entire sphere of influence. I paid off my student loans by working in a field unrelated to my training and in fact one for which a college degree is entirely unnecessary. I maintain that the abuse changed the course of my life, a fact about which I am still bitter.
I’m telling you this now for several reasons.
1. I’m tired of holding it in my body and am ready to release this bitterness.
2. I believe that young students are vulnerable and should be entitled to a safe place in which to complete their educations.
3. College & graduate students are impressionable; the reality is that they are being cultivated as future workers & bosses in every sector of our economy. In this way, sexual misconduct on our campuses contributes to and perpetuates an insidious culture of harassment which spreads throughout the entire economy. For this reason, campus abuse has the potential to harm all workers, not just college students and graduates. 
4. Although I am grateful for my education and believe that you can never foreclose on the knowledge and thinking skills I carry in my head, technically I don’t use my education because I felt too traumatized to pursue the career I studied. 
5. My education was partially funded with public dollars which subsidized my graduate fellowship and student loans. One could argue this public investment was wasted because I never attempted to work in the field for which I trained. If you buy my statement that I was deterred by systematic abuse, that is an egregious betrayal of the public trust & resources. 
",I was a PhD student. ,I Was A Phd Student. ,"My perpetrators were tenured professors.

He engaged in unlimited gossip about his colleagues both in our shared institution and beyond, as well as gossiped to me about my own colleagues.

He inquired into my romantic life and upbringing.

8,2082,"2007, my academic advisor, in a closed door meeting, sat on the edge of his desk, invaded my personal space, and grabbed my ankle. He then said I was very pretty and asked if I wanted to take off my clothes. I refused and told him he was making me uncomfortable. He shrugged and tried to kiss me and when I pulled away, he laughed and sat back in his chair. He then started to justify he proposition saying he’s done things with students in the past and when I expressed disappointment for disrespecting his marriage and my relationship status he said that he and his wife have an understanding. I repeated that I wasn’t interested and left his office. He later sent me apologetic emails which I deleted, feeling ashamed and confused. I obsessed about whether I had lead him on or talked about inappropriate things that made him think I was receptive. I told a friend, who told me I was over reacting. I constantly wondered if the A I had received in his class was due to the fact that he wanted to sleep with me and not my developing skill in the subject. Aware of his tenured status in the department, I decided the following semester to change my major and never took another class in his department. Of note, two years later, that same friend who dismissed my concerns, was propositioned by the same professor and finally validated my experience. She and another student who had had similar experiences (being cornered and asked for sexual activity by this professor) went to a female professor in the department and with her guidance, the three of us reported our experiences to the Dean of the college. We were made to recount the experiences and told that they would take it from there.

A male faculty who works with the Veteran students at CCBC made me aware that his wife no longer has sex with him. Each time I had to register for classes, he would take me aside and ask deep personal questions about my life. He told me that he had sexual dreams about me. He made sure that my file was always hidden on his desk. No one else could touch my file. They couldn't even find it. It was normal procedure for me to be forced to wait there for up to 2 hours while they fiddled around looking for my file, called my professors to make sure I could take the class, emailed them and insisted I wait for an email response, and whatever else they were doing. I always had permission to be in the class from the professors and the VA doesn't care what classes I take, so long as this is an accreditted college.

The head of the VA department for CCBC did not care that I was being sexually harassed or that I was forced to wait 2 hours at the Veterans desk at the finance office. He wasn't listening and was instead angry that I refused to go to his frat party where alcohol was served. He then insisted that I was mentally ill for using the adult words, ""CYA"" and ""BS.""

And it is totally BS that they would force me to stand there and wait in their office for hours while they track down professors who have a life.

30,2244,"In a literature class, an older male professor asked women during class whether they’d ever been sexually harassed in academia. Most of us were uncomfortable and unsure how to answer. He kept asking the question, insisting that he did not think sexual harassment occured at our university. Some of us finally answered that we had witnessed, heard about, or experienced sexual harassment on campus (professors making comments about women’s bodies and appearances, unwanted touching, etc.), but kept it general because of the classroom setting we were in. One of my colleagues in class had experienced harassment, making this conversation very awkward and personal. All of the men were staring at the women with disbelief, waiting for us to share personal details of trauma. After we shared vague and anonymous accounta, the professor looked incredulous and proceeded to question whether our experiences had really occurred. I think he was genuinely in disbelief, but somehow didn’t realize that he was contributing to the problem. This professor also routinely made comments in class about undergraduate students’ bodies and clothing. 

Another “celebrity” literature professor told students in class that women tend to be smart or pretty, and rarely both. He treated women who dressed in more feminine clothing much differently in class than other women. He would rush to assist them with simple tasks and comment on how nice they looked.

Instance 2)  Predatory faculty member was dating graduate and undergraduate students. It was an open secret, except to those targeted by professor. Others did not warn students or punish faculty member. 

Instance 3) Also occured when I was in graduate school. I took an undergraduate class in my subfield on an interesting topic, and the professor made sexually inappropriate comments all semester long.

He shrugged and did assign me night classes after that, relieving some pressure on my male colleagues.

Every other female student went along with the harassment but me, and most had sex with him and/or other professors, so I guess it really bothered him that I refused and thus I became a target.

A teacher who I had had the previous semester started coming into my practice room and sitting very close to me on the piano bench, telling me how talented I was. One day he invited me on a hike. I did not know how to say no, so I went. On the hike he very suddenly turned to me and kissed me, sticking his tongue in my mouth. I pulled away and walked down an embankment and sat on a log. I wanted to get away, but I was afraid of making him angry. I didn't know what to do. He followed me and sat down next to me and kissed me again, simultaneously grabbing me between the legs and then said ""I can feel how wet you are for me"". I jumped up and demanded he take me back to campus. He was angry and stormed past me. He took me back, and never spoke to me again.

We invited [redacted] to be our keynote speaker for this event, and I was incredibly excited to talk to him about his work since I respect it so much. The first day I met him, I was excitedly talking about a new book that had just come out, and how it intersected with his work and my own when he interrupted me and asked ""Do you have a partner that helps you with this?"" I was confused and hurt, and responded ""um, absolutely not. I do all of my own work."" He replied ""I'm trying to ask if you're single or not, that's all."" I didn't know what to do since I was shocked for several reasons: one being that he is very public about his marriage and his children, and two, because I was caught off guard. This was the first of many incidents that week with him. I kept trying to keep my other male-identified friends around me, but they also did not understand what the big deal was. I told the group at one point ""[redacted] keeps trying to sleep with me,"" and my ""friend"" said ""awesome, you should do it!"" I was heartbroken, because once again, they didn't understand what it's like to never be asked about your work, but instead treated like someone who is just there to have sex with. On the last night of the event, [redacted] text messaged me on my phone (this is how I found out one of my male friends gave him my number), showed up at the bar we were at, bought me a drink (which I did not drink), and told his ride to go on home without him because I would take him to where he was staying. He lied to me and told me he was getting divorced. I told my friends I didn't want him in my car, and the other event organizer said ""god dammit just take him to xxx's house.""

129,1146,"On my second day of class in my first year of seminary a professor invited me into his office after class. He asked me a series of personal questions under the guise of offering spiritual direction. He asked explicitly about my divorce and current marital status, then raised his eyebrows and informed me that I certainly could be remarried by now. His class lectures frequently revolved around sex, which was unusual for a class in Christian Church History. He would say inappropriate things to the female students. One day he asked about what we think when a ‘hunk’ walks by. He would also make objectifying statements about women. When I complained about it he would tell me that some feminist theologians think that we need to be talking about push up bras and sexuality. He never respected me as a theologian and made clear his amusement of me, particularly when a male classmate made a disparaging remark towards me. My classmates look up to him and he has a good reputation in the community as a pastor. He claims to be a women’s advocate. I doubted my own experiences until he finally commented on my “slinky dress,” (I was wearing a modest sleeveless blouse behind a podium) in a photo of me at a public speaking event at a local  church. He also made fun of a mutual friend and colleague because I had expressed admiration for him as a chaplain (which is the field I’m preparing for.) He would encourage us to speak up and then remind us that the faculty have so much power over grades, and professional/academic recommendations.

130,1402,"I had spent a fair amount of time (a couple of hours) speaking with the chair of a different department at a social event at a university faculty retreat. I had no sexual or romantic interest in him and I made that clear by verbally telling him so at one point in the evening when I felt he crossed a line when he stated that he and I both seemed to have unmet needs. He backed off immediately so I let it go, especially since I believe he had been intoxicated at the time. I am not one to hold a grudge so we became Facebook friends, and that friendship stayed well within what I felt were appropriate boundaries: no more unwelcome advances from him, just mundane liking and commenting on each other's posts, and some good-natured trash talk about sports. Then a few months later our Dean asked me to take on additional responsibilities regarding program level assessment within the college, since that is an interest of mine. In addition to having me advise [the dean] on assessment related matters, she also made me available to the chairs of all the departments in the college so that they could consult with me on implementing best practices for assessing student learning outcomes in their respective programs. The individual in question sent me a private Facebook message telling me that the dean ""gave"" me to him and said that that I have to do whatever he said, and he then suggested that we meet up at the airport Holiday Inn every Friday night to ""talk assessment."" This disturbed me quite a bit, but because I didn't want to make waves I chose to pretend I didn't understand his implication and answered him in earnest that I would be willing to meet in the library with other staff members to talk about assessing his program. He responded by saying that he actually had no interest in talking about assessment and really just wanted to hang out with me, and that regardless of my answer he would still write a favorable letter on my behalf for my upcoming third-year review. This last part was particularly upsetting, because while I knew that I had nothing to fear about my third year review, I felt intimidated and disgusted that he felt so free to imply that he had any authority over my third year review and would dare to link that to his holiday inn invitation. At that point I stopped responding and deleted him as a friend. About a week later he emailed me to say that he had all but forgotten that exchange but just realized that it might have rubbed me the wrong way and that if it did he apologized because he had been drinking, he didn't mean anything inappropriate, and that he hoped we could still be friends. I responded saying that I appreciated his apology, but that I did not feel comfortable interacting with him in any way beyond the most professional capacity. I also told him that I would give him the benefit of the doubt and that I would not be discussing the incident with human resources. I said that last part mostly to make it crystal clear to him that I would be well within my rights to do so, my hope being that he would consider the severity of his actions and resolve to refrain from behavior like that in the future with other colleagues.",My third year as assistant professor,My third year as assistant professor,Full professor at the University and chair of his department,Male,Male,Counseling,Regional College,Undergraduate Student,Chair/Dean/Head, Social sciences

137,2262,"Both instances occurred at a large regional conference for our field within the last five years. This professor had been my undergraduate advisor and mentor (and chair of my undergrad thesis). The first instance occurred during my first semester as a graduate student at a different university. Two female friends of mine (who were still students at the University where the professor taught) and I were hanging out with the professor and a few other (male) professors and former students of his from different institutions at the hotel bar. He was buying my friends and I drinks and had clearly had a few himself before we showed up. Pretty soon the other people we were with left for the night and it was just my two friends and I with the professor drinking and catching up. Pretty soon the conversation turned sexual, with the advances very pointedly directed at me. There was no touching (this time), but the comments were very sexual, and he even insinuated that I should go up to his room with him instead of with my two friends who I was rooming with. It was completely unexpected since this professor never made any remotely sexual passes at me while I was his student. None of us knew how to react except to laugh it off. The next day he approached me and apologized ""if"" he had been inappropriate the night before and blamed it on the alcohol. The last night of the conference we ended up outside the hotel smoking with a group of maybe 10-15 professors and grad students from various universities. He was very drunk again and came up to drunkenly apologize again, but insisted that he hold my hand while doing so. After this conference I began to doubt myself and question if the A's I earned in his classes, the letters of recommendation he wrote, and the research opportunities I had with him were only given to me because he had sexual/romantic feelings for me and not because of my merit as a scholar. Two years later at the same conference I confronted him about the incident (I had seen him a few times since, but it had been kind of awkward and I tried to keep my distance). We had both been drinking, but him especially. He told me that he ""loved me in many ways"" but that he would never give me recommendations or opportunities I didn't deserve based on my abilities. I believed him and I felt that we had reached some sort of resolution with the whole thing. Then, a bit later that night he went to two female friends I had been with during the first incident and propositioned them to come up to his room with him to keep him company. That sense of resolution immediately went out the window. After the conference he contacted me to apologize. I insisted that he also reach out to my two friends and apologize to them, which he did.

He even went as far as to spread horrible rumors about me to other graduate students in our program. Some of the rumors were sexual in nature. Others were about my ""incompetence"" in our field.

172,2130,"I have heard so many stories, so will just report my own. I will only report three main ones. 1) In 2002 I was a brand new graduate student doing fieldwork in a remote location. I was warned in advance that the PI had a ""reputation"" so I was wary. After about a week we were all sitting around a campfire. I had avoided him, but he seemed to find me. He sat down and started talking. I admit to being abrupt with him, but didn't want to be rude so started talking more. He seemed just conversational but then asked about my body, which took me off guard. He laughed and said he just wanted to know what sports I had done in high school to shape my body for life. After telling him I had been a cheerleader he would frequently come up to me after and during work and say, ""You know, I had always wanted to date a cheerleader..."". It just just awkward, but these comments went on and on every day. No specific one seemed overtly disgusting, but I just wished it wasn't happening. There was a lot of drinking and smoking pot and playing games and as the fieldwork progressed it started to feel ""normal"" somehow. It seemed like he really liked me. I started to feel flattered. One night he kissed me. I broke it off, and he started to feel my chest. I told him no, and he persisted a bit but ultimately backed away...but he barely spoke to me for the rest of the fieldwork (many weeks). He found someone else who would sleep with him, which was a very clear message that had been his only plan the entire time. I felt dirty and used, like it was my fault, that I had instigated or encouraged it, and that there was no way I could ever tell anyone because I would be the fool who didn't see it coming. After all, hadn't I been adequately warned? A year or so later I saw him at a conference. I tried to sit away from him at dinner after the talks. He got drunker and drunker, and would not leave me alone. There was dancing. He would dance over to me and comment on how I moved, persistently, trying to touch me. I would just laugh and move away, trying to make light of it. I walked back to my hotel in a group, and said goodbye to them all in the lobby. The next thing I knew, he was calling my room at 3am asking if I could come see him. I had many roommates, one of whom answered the phone. I told him no way, but I'm sure it damaged my reputation. I just never had the guts to try to explain it to anyone. Fortunately, he was a PI at another institution and I never had to deal with him after that. He was married and had two kids the whole time. 2) In 2004 I was a mid-level graduate student and I was doing fieldwork in a different place. There was a senior graduate student who was in a supervisory position (married, with two kids). Several of us took a night off on a weekend to go into a town, and stayed in a hostel. There was drinking. This man got very drunk and was all over me, whispering in my ear ""I'm going to make you come over and over"" and groping me. I told him no, no, no, so many times. I tried to squirm away. I didn't want to make a fuss about it because I had to work with him, and everyone knew him as the ""dirty old man"" anyway so I figured they would just see it as me making a big deal out of nothing. I could not seem to get away from him without raising a fuss. We were in a shared room with several other people and I took the top bunk. He got up there with me, trying to touch me, and I just kept shoving him away with my feet. I really didn't want to make the situation awkward for other people, or for myself when everyone woke up the next morning and had to go back to work together. I must have stayed like that for an hour or more, just shoving his hands back with my feet through my sleeping bag until eventually I guess he just passed out. The next morning he pretended like nothing had happened, and every once in a while I see him and he hugs too long, squeezes too tight...but he does that to all the women, so I feel like if I brought it up I would look conceited. There were rumors that all the men (PIs and male graduate students) would get together and rate the female graduate students and undergraduates on the fieldwork. I can't know if any of that was actually true, but I would not be surprised. 3) In 2016 I was a TT Asst. Prof. I thought all of this was behind me. I am married with two children. I did not think I would be a target any longer, because I was now ""old"" and cynical. I was invited to attend a workshop. Afterwards, several of us colleagues went out...and out...and out. We just kept going from place to place, chatting, having a great time, generating ideas. We were in a group. It felt like my grad school years, but the good parts of them. I chatted for a while with someone who was probably about my age. We knew a lot of the same people, but had never met in person. I showed abundant pictures of my husband and family. He seemed to like seeing them. At the last place, the music was loud. I went to the bathroom and when I came back everyone was gone except for this guy. I asked where they went and he said they had all left. I thought that was weird, and since I had been following the group I didn't really know where I was. I started trying to figure out how to get back to my lodging. A rad song from the 80s started playing and I said I liked it. This guy said I should dance to it then. So we danced, not touching, in a crowd. It was fun - I hadn't done something like that in maybe 10 years. We kept dancing, and he kept getting closer. I kept trying to keep it light, keep my distance, but he kept getting closer and I could not find a way to move away without making it awkward, feeling like he was trying something that I was telling myself he couldn't possibly be trying. After all, he'd seen my family photos and I was no longer a young, naive graduate student right? It just kept happening and I couldn't find a way to stop the situation without bringing attention to it. I felt like that would be awkward, sort of like accusing him of something, which to me felt both conceited and like it could become an issue if we ever worked together in the future. Eventually he pulled me in all of a sudden and planted a huge kiss on my mouth. That was a pretty clear signal that it wasn't all in my head, so I pushed him away and scolded him and reminded him I was happily married. He just smiled and acted like nothing had happened and tried again...and again...after a couple of minutes of trying to ""be normal"" I just gave up and said I needed to go. He walked with me, pretending like nothing had happened. I felt a terrible, awful guilt - just like back in grad school, like I must have been responsible for it simply because I hadn't made a big protest about it at the start. He kept trying to take me on all these detours back to my lodging to ""show me things around the city"". I eventually just got out my phone and found it myself, feeling stupid that I had let that happen on top of everything else. I still feel terrible, like I've done something wrong. I saw him later at a conference and pretended he didn't exist; he did the same. It all felt so childish, stupid, and like being back in high school, which was very distracting when I was supposed to be at a professional conference. Those are just three incidents. They do not include all the many times I have to greet senior men and they hug too long, kiss on the cheek too long, and make comments about my appearance. One committee member told me at my dissertation defense (in front of the crowd) that I sure didn't look like I'd just had a baby (my son was about a month old at the time). It's just tiring.

When I started, I did not know what would be the international standards to present doctoral thesis at international conferences etc. Me and other female PhD students were held back a lot, whereas a male and politically active PhD student who started later was pushed to present at these conferences right from the beginning. This was even harder as I and other female PhDs were buried with more administrational work than the male colleagues and my PhD supervisor started to use ideas from my thesis as his. I experienced this afterwards, too, that he would do this with his other female PhD students. He would work with us intensely and if some other male professor said something against it, he started to say he never knew what we were doing and that it's bad and irrelevant. These things piled up during the PhD and afterwards he would push the new head of the department into the same direction telling that I wouldn't do interesting stuff. This person then said that someone like me cannot work in such an exotic field and he took up some ideas himself - and told me, that he expected his PostDocs to kneel in front of him as he did 20 years ago. They tried hard to get me out of my contract and when I tried to go to higher instances at the university, some people started to mutter that this might come out of a former sexual relationship that I might have stopped. Such nonesense! In the end, I got no help, so I quit my position. There were quite a few more in a similar situation, 3 quit, others worked until they reached their habilitation without any help of their male supervisor, on the contrary, many of them tried to make this way as hard as possible for them. One thing I have to add that 20 women got this tenure position to push females in university position, but it seems that especially those had the hardest time. 4 years later the new head of the university gave an order to do a study on the problems, I was interviewed and all interviewers were shocked what happened to me and most other women in this cohort.

Then our hands were overlapping on the mouse, and then one day, I got an inappropriate kiss that was too close to my lips for comfort.  I spoke to other students in my class and they did not believe me since this Professor acted so distant in the classroom.  To make a long story short, he was very upset when I professionally ended working with him, and then to make matters worst, his best friend wrote me a terrible letter of rec. and made my quals a living nightmare. In addition to this, another faculty member who knew him, and who I was trying to conduct research with, stopped writing back to me.

198,527,"There is one man I know who has a terrible reputation for inappropriate behavior among almost all of the women who know him.  In my last two years of graduate school, I became a member of the same society of fellows that he belonged to.  This fellowship invites its graduated fellows back once a year, so I see him every year that I attend.  He is now a tenured professor at a respected university.

It is hard to explain how insidious this man's actions are.  I first met him in my first year of graduate school, when he briefly dated a friend of mine.  He was extremely full of himself, and when I saw him now and then at school events, he was one of those awful men who made long-winded comments in the Q & A.  But I really only got to know him when I was inducted into the fellowship, and he targeted me.

Every year, he has this habit of identifying the newest, prettiest women, and he follows them around flirting/insulting them.  At the fellowship meeting that first year, as I asked this (married) professor for advice about the job market, he would sprinkle in little comments like ""If only I had met you earlier...""  I was initially flattered, but over time I began to see that it was a ritual.  The last time I attended, he (and a few other senior male colleagues) latched onto a beautiful graduate student.  When he is in this predatory mode, he will come over and put an arm around your shoulders or a hand on your waist.  He will get in your personal space, and treat it like a game when you try to rebuff him.

I graduated, moved on to my postdoc, and one year into it, he became a visiting scholar at the same institution.  In fact, he was put at the next desk over.  He was always leaning around the partition to bother me, and there was always a sexual undertone.  This is where it gets harder to pin down though.  The only specific incident that I can remember is when we were talking to a couple of other people and I said something about a box, and he gave suggestive look a look and said ""Your BOX?""  It was things like that.  Always bringing it back to sex, when we were in our WORKPLACE.  And then when it was about work, such as at my public lecture, he would tell people behind my back about how unoriginal my ideas were or how unconvincing my argument was.

I complained about him so much that after I left the postdoc, my boyfriend (now husband) encouraged me to unfriend him on Facebook.  That was liberating, even though he made comments about it at the next annual meeting.

I knew I wasn't the only one who felt this way (the mere mention of his name often elicits an eye roll), but I was surprised when a friend at another school brought him up this fall (pre-Harvey Weinstein).  She was a graduate student a few years before me, and she'd had the same experience.  We had been talking about inappropriateness from male colleagues in general, and she said something like, ""Well, you-know-who is the worst.""  I suddenly though, Yeah, isn't it a problem that all of these women have felt threatened by him?

I know you will hear much worse stories, but this type of sexual harassment is completely pervasive and undermines our careers.  It is men treating women as sexual objects rather than colleagues.  It doesn't matter what you wear or how you act.  These men perpetuate an uncomfortable atmosphere for women, make us insecure about our self-image and our accomplishments, and have the power to pass on their opinions to others.","graduate student (Penn), then post-doc (NYU)","graduate student (Penn), then post-doc (NYU)","senior fellow in my graduate fellowship (Penn) and professor at another institution, and then visiting scholar (with tenure I believe) at my postdoc (NYU).
