0,"I don't even know where to start, so many things happened when I was a graduate student. One professor made wildly inappropriate comments and discussions about his sexual past in class. Every class. He once asked me, when I came to class with a bruise on my face from falling off of my bike, ""What? Does your boyfriend beat you or something?"" (in front of the entire class). Another professor physically assaulted me by slapping my arm hard and grabbing it to get me off of a wheelchair ramp (I didn't realize it was a wheelchair ramp, and there wasn't a wheelchair user coming). He later screamed at me in front of undergraduate students. I had a male graduate student peer smack me on the backside with his backpack when were were standing in front of an entire lecture hall full of undergraduates. When I was an undergraduate a departmental admin. assistant started a rumor that I was sleeping with a male professor. Oh, I have also faced some  awful harassment from some male undergraduates, when I was a graduate student and again as a Visiting Assistant Professor.",Humanities,Multiple,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,189
1,"In my third year of BA, almost immediately after my first supervision with my dissertation supervisor (Lecturer), he text me to ask if I wanted to meet in a hotel. Thinking this was a prank or he meant a hotel coffee shop I dropped by his office to ask what was going on. He told me he had meant casual sex in a hotel-he pointed out how successful women who had said yes had gone on to become, promised me a position on a work experience placement, promised me other perks if I said yes. I said no. That’s when the harassment started. It ranged from him attempting to kiss me during meetings, constant texts, lewd comments, bullying, personal comments, his screen saver blowing x’s (kisses) at me during class, him telling stories of historic occasions when someone said no (I knew the point he was making but the class was confused!), the contacts struggle to get feedback or support for my dissertation without having to be nice to him, be gentle, don’t rock the boat, say no without making him angry. It seems I wasn’t alone. Just as it had reached the point where I was in so deep and struggling a verbal memo was passed around the dept-anyone heard making allegations against this Lecturer would be suspended. This silenced me. I’ve onlybtold two people-my best friend during and my Husband.  I got through the year and then started my MA with a different supervisor. The harassment is some form continued and I was so disheartened and frustrated I tried to get through the course quickly and did not engage in post grad life within the dept. The Lecturer and I stayed in touch every now and then-mostly reference requests. When I decided to return to do a PhD he agreed to meet and discuss my options-I though I’m older, wiser, married so it’ll be different. It wasn’t-as soon as he realised I would continue to say no but that I was more confident in myself (plus I have a Husband built like The Rock!) he became really rude and personal. He told me that there was no point in me doing a PhD-I was too stupid, I should retrain (despite successfully working in the field between my MA and wanting to do a PhD), I would wouldn’t finish the PhD as I might have children or my husbands and might leave me. I held it together until I left-then I cried. I’m now about 6 months of submitting my PhD thesis-a wonderful experience with two supportive male supervisors.

He shrugged and tried to kiss me and when I pulled away, he laughed and sat back in his chair. He then started to justify he proposition saying he’s done things with students in the past and when I expressed disappointment for disrespecting his marriage and my relationship status he said that he and his wife have an understanding. I repeated that I wasn’t interested and left his office. He later sent me apologetic emails which I deleted, feeling ashamed and confused. I obsessed about whether I had lead him on or talked about inappropriate things that made him think I was receptive. I told a friend, who told me I was over reacting. I constantly wondered if the A I had received in his class was due to the fact that he wanted to sleep with me and not my developing skill in the subject. Aware of his tenured status in the department, I decided the following semester to change my major and never took another class in his department. Of note, two years later, that same friend who dismissed my concerns, was propositioned by the same professor and finally validated my experience. She and another student who had had similar experiences (being cornered and asked for sexual activity by this professor) went to a female professor in the department and with her guidance, the three of us reported our experiences to the Dean of the college. We were made to recount the experiences and told that they would take it from there.

His behavior was well known: he had an open string of girlfriends drawn from the graduate pool over the years. He had one when he hit on me. Presumably she was wowed by trips to France and fine wine. But his contempt for women was obvious. By that time he was in his 60s.
I took my qualifying exams and left the institution to scratch out a study site on my own to complete my dissertation. I fought hard - without meaningful letters of recommendation - for a career in academia. Even still, 20 years later, I do not have a network of invested academics 'who raised me'. 
The response of the institution - a female chair at the time- was cliche. ""Oh that's just how he is and we can't legislate love"".  LOVE?? 
It easily set my career back 10 years, but I guess, after having read so many stories of women ""hounded out"" (excellent terms, btw), I should consider myself ""one of the lucky ones"".

At a Christmas party he had some drinks and approached me, saying that he knew I was uncomfortable with his fascination with me, but that he was married and it ""wasn't sexual"". He took a photo of me at the party that night and told me sent it to a friend of his to ""show"" him the kind of young women he worked with.

The department took no action against this student. He went on to win an award and get a tenure-track job. One of the most disturbing parts is that his research is about doing ethnographic research on incarcerated juvenile girls, so who knows what kinds of disturbing access he has to this vulnerable population and what types of things he may have tried to do.

One of my first ones was in a small art history department at a well-known art school. An older male (full-time) faculty member was very friendly. He was European, single and it was initially unclear to me how to interpret his somewhat excessive attention. All of the department faculty—part-time and full—shared a room dominated by his desk and the adjacent desk of the woman who chaired the department. One day I was seated nearby, preparing for my class. The chair was busy on a phone call and the male prof suddenly asked me why in African sculpture male genitals were so “exaggerated.” Annoyed by the question, I was a silent for a second. The real answer I knew was that in African art male and female genitalia symbolize human and agricultural fertility. But doubting his interest was strictly intellectual, I decided to shut down the discussion by deadpanning, “Oh, they’re not exaggerated.” I saw an amused grin on the woman chair’s face.

I had an A in the class, but he would pull me aside after class to demand I meet him in his office to 'discuss' my grades. I agreed once and brought another female student with me, which angered him. He began making negative comments to me in class, so I withdrew close to the last withdrawal date.

I cherished them as friends and mentors. The ""chair"" of my shadow committee was a man who is about 20 years my senior and was 4 or 5 years ahead of me in the program.  He was a self-described feminist who was well known for his somewhat radical sexual ethics.
In the summer of my first year, both my ""shadow chair"" and I were going to be in Europe. We made a plan to meet up and spend several days being tourists together. The night before he flew over (my flight was a few days later) he confessed that he was deeply attracted to me and wanted to pursue a sexual relationship. I was stunned and said ,""thank you for telling me."" The next time I saw him was in Europe. I felt scared and uncertain; like I could either lose him as a friend and mentor or, somehow, part of me.

He's married and I have discouraged him from these types of highly charged messages. I have sought to redirect his amorous attention back to his marriage. I would like to preserve this mentorship/friendship, and have tried to be empathetic to circumstances which might be leading him to seek out sexual fulfillment in me. However, this has really damaged my view of him and has negatively impacted me. I've started to wonder if I he wrote my letters of recommendation because he was sexually attracted to me and does this mean I'm not fit for academic work? 

Another incident mirrored this when I was a student on a competitive speech team at the same age when I was my mentor's student. I received explicit messages from my married coach about how ""sexy"" and ""pretty"" and ""hot"" I was. ""What would you think of me doing X to your body"".

In that particular case, I was wearing grubby hiking shorts -- they weren't remotely provocative, and even if they were...
Another professor was a notorious womanizer -- I was warned by the female grad students ahead of me that most of them had slept with him because he was influential in the field and that if you wanted a career, it was part of paying your dues. Just a couple of weeks into starting the program, I went to his office hours because I was having some trouble with one of the readings -- he told me to shut the door, then he pulled a bottle of liquor out of his file cabinet and invited me to have a drink and discuss with him the ""sex appeal of ideas."" That kind of creeped me out. The following year I was in a small seminar with him -- five women, and one of them really having trouble because she wasn't very good in the foreign language of the readings. But she was sleeping with him at the time, and it was ridiculous in the discussions how he would favor her and dismiss the rest of us. But he ended up ditching his wife and marrying her -- and she was only a couple of years older than his son.
The bisexual wife of one of my profs regularly hit on me at department parties. One of her girlfriends used to hit on me too.
Another of my profs was having an affair with a grad student. She got pregnant. Her father was a grey eminence in the field at another institution, so he told the prof (who was on the tenure track, but not tenured yet) that if he didn't divorce his wife and marry his daughter, he would make sure he was blackballed.

I left town, got married and started a new job, and would periodically call and leave messages for the professor--or sometimes reach him, upon which he'd promise to get the notes to me (but then wouldn't). The university actually allowed me to ""walk"" at graduation but my degree wasn't officially awarded. This went on for about a year.
Finally, during one phone call, my professor said that he'd be attending a conference in a city about an hour from where I lived, and that I should meet him there at the hotel, where he'd ""go over the notes with me."" From the tone of his voice, it was clear that he intended much more than a platonic discussion, and it was of course completely unnecessary for me to be in his presence to get his notes. 
Instead, I called my thesis chair and told him what the professor had suggested. I also pointed out how long I'd been waiting.

He kept asking the question, insisting that he did not think sexual harassment occured at our university. Some of us finally answered that we had witnessed, heard about, or experienced sexual harassment on campus (professors making comments about women’s bodies and appearances, unwanted touching, etc.), but kept it general because of the classroom setting we were in. One of my colleagues in class had experienced harassment, making this conversation very awkward and personal. All of the men were staring at the women with disbelief, waiting for us to share personal details of trauma. After we shared vague and anonymous accounta, the professor looked incredulous and proceeded to question whether our experiences had really occurred.

I was shocked by how accepting everyone seemed of this. I spoke to the HoD, asking - are these rumours true? He said they were, but wrung his hands, saying, ""there's nothing we can do."" I was devastated! He said if confronted, the colleague would simply lie, subtly pointing out that the man's wife was head of HR for the whole University. He said - what I will do is move the student out of his office, which they were sharing(!). He got her her own office, and that was meant to be that. I looked up the University's code of ethics governing staff-student relationships and you could drive a truck through it. It turned out he'd written it. I felt sick about it all but couldn't see any action to take, particularly given other colleagues were turning a blind eye. One who worked in feminist philosophy remarked that the students concerned were over the age of consent and she didn't hold with 'seeing women as victims'. A few years later a complaint came in from the high schools where we taught Ethics and guess who was super-keen to go out there and deliver it? The complaint was about inappropriate contact after hours (texting) with a 16 year old girl. I was so upset. The University only investigated after certain people pushed hard from inside. I never found out the results, and the colleague remained in place until he died of alcohol-related illness. 
What I want to comment on re. all this is that given the colleague was employed for over 30 years, how very many female students must have been caught up in the behaviour - and what happened to their educations? (If any are reading this, please consider that you may have been abused, even if you thought it was consensual.) Also, the wife who was head of HR for the whole University knew all about the behaviour, protected him for years, and even today she is still in place. I consider that appalling.

I complied, and then when I ran for the door I had a head start and was able to run underneath his arm as he tried to block me in. I ran back to my dorm room and locked the door.

73,"During the visit weekend for accepted students, I met a tenured faculty member who, upon learning of my research interests, mentioned a dataset he had that I could use for a project. This was my first interaction with him, and it seemed ultimately quite positive. 

Later that evening was a dinner at this professor's home for current and admitted graduate students and faculty. At one point he came up to me in the kitchen and began asking me if I had read a recently published magazine article about how women were entering into casual sexual relationships so they could focus on their careers. This had absolutely nothing to do with my research interests or our previous conversations, and my gut instincts told me he was trying to hit on me or test some kind of boundary. I felt panicked and didn't know how to respond, especially since he had offered that research opportunity to me earlier. As a defense mechanism, I tried to exit the conversation as quickly as possible and tried to hide how upset I felt.

A female junior faculty member was close by and, I believe, heard the entire thing, but did not step in at all. I clearly remember her giving me a look as though I was the one who encouraged it, and she didn't follow-up with me or anything. I left the room as soon as I could and immediately told a few other admitted students, who shared my alarm. I never told anyone in the department because I didn't know any faculty well enough to bring it up, and I also was worried it would make me look bad or ruin potential professional connections.

I ultimately decided not to go to that program because of this encounter, even though this was the highest ranked program I got into. I later found out from other women that they had similar encounters with this particular faculty member.", Social sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,320
74,"My MSc advisor verbally abused and sexually harassed me, sometimes in front of undergraduates in the lab. My lack of smiling displeased him so he would take me outside and walk me around the campus, berating me (probably so no one in the dept could hear him), telling me I was a nothing and a nobody and by letting me in his lab he was doing me a huge service and I should treat him better since it was a privilege for me to be there. After the move to the new place where I didn't know anyone and was being berated, I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed some medication. It made me sleep all the time and my progress slowed. I finally decided I should talk to my advisor because of this to let him know what was going on. I didn't tell him he was part of the problem. However, he was not sympathetic, made fun of me, and I left his office in tears. I was blamed for anything that ever went wrong in the lab, even if it wasn't my fault. Sometimes this would lead to me having to dig through the hazmat to find samples that I'd thrown away because they didn't work so he could double check they didn't work (they didn't). He once told me that when he saw my face he heard a ""giant sucking sound, a void."" I didn't know much as a first year grad student, but when I would ask questions I as berated with things like, ""How could you possibly not know that?"" He threw rocks at me in the field, made me keep working/hiking when I was pretty badly injured one day, would yell at me if I made his food wrong (once he made me watch him make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich so he could show me how it was done). He made fun of/commented on how I dressed/looked, often. He hit the back of my seat in the car because I changed the radio station. Then the worst, the things that would make me cringe and freeze. Telling me which grad students in the dept he thought were cute. Once when he opened the freezer some things of mine fell out and rolled under it. He shut the door and walked away. I asked him if he was going to pick them up and he said, ""No, I want to watch you bend over."" Once, in the car with a male undergraduate, he told him to ""Look at [my name's] tits. Look how dirty they are!"" because we had been working outside and on the ground.",Natural sciences,Other Type of School,Other,Graduate Student,Faculty,445
75,"At UCLA when I was teaching as a visiting instructor and then a graduate student  from 2006 to 2008 there were two senior professor who sexually harassed me. None of them is the professor accused in the recent Title IX case involving a History professor. One of the professors professed his love for me and was constantly stalking me as if to casually run into me and have an opportunity to strike a conversation and/or invite me for a date. He was notorious for pursuing graduate students in his department and no-one bat an eye when they saw him harassing me. He was a senior professor and my situation back them was typically quite vulnerable, especially when I became an international graduate student and had enormous sums to pay for my education. He helped me learn about fellowships and may have put in good word so that I won some of those, which put me in the delicate position of having to put up with his advances. The other professor, from my graduate program, would call me to his office regularly to theoretically discuss class work. In reality, he took that opportunity to harass me. He'd shut the door immediately after I would come in and then force a conversation about his youth and how much he'd like me, saying things like ""Had I known you when I was young..."" At one point he insisted on putting a piece of candy (from his native country) directly on my mouth, which I resisted. I wasn't familiar with that move, but as I saw it had clear sexual connotations.

76,"The Provost that supervised me at the time kept inviting me to do personal activities (i.e. go out to dinner ""for a meeting"" or to a college-related activity) with him.  When he indicated that he wanted the relationship to become intimate at one of those ""meetings"", I realized that I was in a terrible situation.",Humanities,Regional College,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,56
77,"We were working at the same projet. At the beginning he started with comments on my look when it was clear that I was not interested in him, he started to make critiques and label me as ""lesbian"", ""aggressive"", ""difficult person"", ""impossible to 'manage'""...when my supervisor (female) was still at the university there was a non written agreement on my hiring at the department. When my supervisor got retired and the man became associate professor he removed me from any research group and activity.", Social sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,84
78,"This is about gender discrimination and bullying. I was bullied by sr male colleagues over a 12+ yr period, beginning right after tenure, continuing for the 12+ years that two men were dept chair. I stood up for women colleague being driven out of dept, which instigated bullying me. Both chairs constantly belittled me to others, behind my back and occasionally to my face. I had higher teaching load than everyone else one semester, I almost never got raises, I didn't get internal grants (which everyone else got), I was never on a search or tenure committee, I taught larger lecture courses than others. The worst part is I began to take on their critique of me, that I was not competent, unprofessional, not a research scholar, etc. My situation is far better now, but I never fully recovered. One of those bullying chairs also had an affair with a graduate student in dept at the time, paid her a settlement of some kind when the affair ended.",Humanities,Research Institute,Male,Faculty,Graduate Student,168
79,"I was at a departmental function -- Christmas drinks or or some such -- during my time as a masters student and witnessed an undergrad crying because a prof had just pinned her against a vending machine and tried to put his hand up her skirt. The prof was verbally reprimanded by a senior faculty member at the event itself, but nothing else was done about his behaviour.
