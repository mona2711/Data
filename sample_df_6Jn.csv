3,"I was hired to work as a post-doc with the head of the department. Several people had warned me against working with her, but I have worked with difficult people before so I brushed their warnings off. She asked me pointed questions about my husband and child during the interview, and when I clearly reacted like that was inappropriate, she laughed and said, ""Oh, I know I'm not supposed to ask, but we have *such* a family-friendly atmosphere here that I just want to let you know that you'd be welcome."" When I showed up for work, visibly pregnant, she looked me up and down slowly and scowled, and began to ""talk around me"", not to me. When I met with her that week to discuss work goals, she told me I was ""stupid and crazy"" for being pregnant as a post-doc, and that she ""wouldn't have hired me if she had known that I was pregnant"". She suggested that I should have aborted once I got the job with her, so I could focus on my career. Hilariously, she recounted tales of how she SCUBA-dived when she was a pregnant post-doc, basically saying that she could accomplish research when she was pregnant, but that I wouldn't be capable at doing so. She also gave me unwanted advice, such as getting a C-section was preferable so that I wouldn't wreck myself ""down there"". She gave me this particular advice several times, including on the day I gave birth. She purposefully put up roadblocks to my research (switching goals capriciously), and made it difficult for me to work on my project, and then tried to pin my difficulties on me. I had filed a complaint with HR after that first meeting, because I could sense that she was trying to find ways to fire me. Shortly before I filed, there was another complaint by a staffer in the department filed against my boss for creating a hostile work environment, unrelated to my situation.

He held my hand and told me to 'please not make it an age thing'. I was embarrassed and horrified, as I'd considered him to be a second mentor and believed he'd respected me as a future colleague. I extracted myself and wrote him a letter asking him to cease as it made me feel uncomfortable, and that if he didn't, I would take matters to the university.

As a new graduate student I did not know that this was his MO, and he had asked my friend to keep it a secret, so it was a weird and stressful year, compounded by him making inappropriate comments throughout the year. At the department holiday department, he and another one of my professors who I was chatting with started to talk about how hot they think Asian women are literally over my head (as an aside: I am short, and while it normally is not sexual harassment, men often start to talk about something else literally over my head instead of shifting positions to directly speak to each other when I'm in a group, and it is infuriating).

Translated, it read: ""Men have dreamed of it, this equipment department has done it [created this sign]"".

Based on prior experience I knew the two of them would act somewhat badly, so I warned my younger female students that there might be off color jokes etc. The senior French archaeologist acted badly beyond anything I could have anticipated. Not only were there stupid and childish homophobic jokes and generally stupid male banter between the two senior males, but the French archaeologist also proceeded to talk in a disgusting and sexist manner about the local indigenous women in Church who we had seen on the weekend, discussing their body parts and how he would like to have sex with them (in a much more vulgar manner). All of this was in front of three younger female field assistants who came to me later in a panic- they had never experienced this sort of behavior before (being sexually harassed), one put it this way- that she had never felt so uncomfortable but at the same time that she had no power to say anything to ask the behavior to stop. I decided I had to confront my co-PI and tell him that this French researcher would no longer be invited into the field to work with me as he was sexually harassing the female students. My co-Pi (remember this is my former dissertation chair) blamed the whole incident on me- I was told that yes, this French archaeologist was a sexist but that I just had to deal with it, and moreover, I had been ""pushing his buttons"" so whatever had happened was my fault.

A man sat beside me and we had to introduce ourselves and write down a question to find out more about them. This individual wrote down that he just wanted to be with me. I laughed it off because I thought I would never see this guy again. Sadly, he became a physical and virtual stalker to the point that he was following me places. I used to like to work late at the university (the grad building) and he had overheard me telling someone I was going to be there late. I drove by the place at 11pm and he was standing outside the door (you needed a pass to get in). I kept driving. He stalked me to the point where I was scared for my safety. He would send me numerous message (several an hour late at night --- and I stopped responding to them). He also met with my supervisor to find out more about me. My supervisor didn't know at the time that this guy had begun to be obsessive, so naively he gave him information about me (he was under the impression that I knew this stalker and that we were friends). The stalker would send me messages saying that my supervisor wanted me to meet with him (among other things) and when I stopped responding, his emails got more and more threatening and hostile. I told my supervisor who agreed that there was something wrong, so he met with the guy. The guy continued to put things (notes, presents, etc.) in my department mailbox, email me and stalk me. I finally went to the police and they gave me tips on how to stay safe (never walk alone, let others know where you are, don't reply to the guy, etc.) and told me to wipe my online profile, so I did.

The two women most likely to supervise my work were obviously having their own struggles: one had a four year old and complained to me that she couldn't get away for conferences. She saw me as a sympathetic ear when I went to a Kathy Acker conference, rather than someone she would want to champion. The other, though established, obviously didnt get institutional respect and was not terribly active nor current. Mid-MA, a new hire came back to his hometown where I was studying. I was stunned how much the work he was doing around class and urbanism overlapped with the digressive research I had begun during a seminar paper on Ulysses. I found out he founded the poetry collective which was the primary draw to me studying in this region. I was a bit overwhelmed by all of this consonance. It seemed mutual (I thought, lol) and we began to work together. It was all independent because for some reason he wasn't teaching graduate classes right away. During this time I began to write about art. Of course, coincidentally, he wrote about art too. I began seeing him around at art functions & got a variously flirty and disparaging vibe. I thought he was a wonderful candidate for friend-supervisor-contermporary. His relationship to academia and being a prof was obviously troubled (by his working class roots/Marxism?). There was obviously some mutual magnetism, but what began to happen is this: He began to check out my chest during meetings. He neglected to pay any attention to my work or progress. He seemed really struck when I changed my hair from curly to straight. I finally got him into a meeting about my work and he asked if I had taken my ideas from an architect we mutually knew. He eventually titled an essay loosely based on the concept/metaphor I had created (the one he thought I was fed by the architect). I thought it was my fault for slightly crushing on him. But I have to wonder: WHAT MALE GRAD STUDENT DOESNT BRING HIS BASIC DRIVE INTO HIT GRADUATE WORK? And what male supervisor who decides to champion him isn't in some ways responding to that? I decide to write about art ""instead"" of pursuing academia. I see this person at conferences still (I am still academic adjacent though my writing and I adjunct). The vibe is just as weird.

43,"December 1990. I had graduated from my B.A. in French, and was in France for a year. My advisor invited me to meet him and his wife for coffee one evening. Because I had babysat their two children through my undergraduate studies, I thought it was a lovely gesture, and agreed to meet them. The venue changed from a coffee house to a bar--again, not a problem, because I knew them well. I arrived, and my advisor was in his car smoking a joint, and beckoned to me to get in the car with him. He said that his wife couldn't make it, and asked if I wanted to go see a particularly gawdy Christmas light display with him nearby. He started the car, and drove toward it, then parked. He grabbed my hand and shoved it between his legs, and pulled me close. I was so stunned, I didn't know what to do, but pulled away while he told me of his stress getting tenure, then having terrible reviews from his graduate students the semester before. He kept talking, then drove back to the bar. We went inside, and I tried to act as though nothing was strange, then left quickly after finishing a beer.
I was upset, but thought he was high and would forget about a lapse in judgement. I did go to graduate school, and was forced to take a sparsely attended rhetoric class that he was teaching, because ***'s class was full. It was a topic I loved, but throughout the class, my professor continued to harass me, suggesting first that my paper was brilliant (but only gave me a B+), and offered to help me in his library carrel. I didn't go. He gave me information about a conference, and told me that I should submit a paper there. I hesitated, and he called me one night, asking me if I was going, so he would be sure to go, too. I didn't submit a proposal--even though it would have been a great opportunity for a first semester master's student. 
I avoided him for the rest of my studies, and did well. I was given a paid position assisting the editor of a major journal, and the graduate advisor asked me to stay for my PhD. 
Unfortunately, my professor presented a question on my master's exam that I could never have anticipated--it had nothing to do with my studies, and did not allow me to demonstrate what I did know, and so far from what other students were given that I was blown away. I knew a little--it was related to a French psychologist--and tried to answer, but was absolutely devastated, and sat in the exam sobbing for two hours before trying to write--about two pages, actually--then leaving. All the events in the car, and for that semester, came back to me, and I realized that he wanted me gone.
In my orals, the department head sat beside me, and reassured me as I talked about the other questions. The question from my harasser did not come up once, and I tried to mention it (had become nearly an expert by the time of those exams!), but the committee kept switching the topic, and then said that the question was ""unusual"". The harassing professor did not say much at all that day, which was very unlike him. 
The following week, the graduate advisor told me that he was ashamed of my written exam, and told me that I was not allowed to return. I did, however, pass my master's exam. I really felt that they wanted to get rid of me quickly and quietly.
I am incredibly grateful, in particular, to one professor, who believed me. He was excluded from my exam process because they scheduled the exam while he was on an extended trip to Brazil. He told me that he felt this had been intentional. He was extremely well regarded (***'s biographer, among other things), so it meant a lot to me that he tried to help me.

On another occasion, another female student and I were comparing the boots we were wearing as they both had decorative straps on them. The lab manager interjected, asking us whether those straps were used to hold our legs up during sex. These are a few of the more salient incidents with this lab manager, there are many other passing comments made over the 3 years I worked in that lab that made me uncomfortable. While I didn't feel safe calling him out directly, I made it as clear as I could that his behaviour was unacceptable to me. I did not laugh or respond to his comments.

60,"In 2012 I was a postdoc and attended a national conference out of state. On the last day of the conference, at the conference dinner, I sat at a table of people I did not previously know. During dinner, I spoke at length with the man sitting next to me, who worked in a different area than I and who was at mid-career academic status. We talked about our research, our universities (we worked in the same state in different cities), and our families. As I often do, I mentioned my husband multiple times throughout our conversation-- partly because I like talking about him and I'm very proud of what he does but also to make it clear that I was married and not interested in talking to this person for any other reason than professional interest. This man also talked about his wife and family. I had no reason to suspect that our conversation was perceived by him as anything other than professional. After dinner, some colleagues that I knew were moving on with a group to a nearby bar, and this man I had been speaking with at dinner joined us to walk over. When we got to the bar, people ordered drinks then sat down at tables-- this man came and sat next to me, and many other colleagues were sat around the table. Shortly after we sat down, he discreetly moved his hand back to my rear end and began jamming his thumb between my buttocks. I was startled and jumped slightly, shocked that this was happening at all, especially in a crowded table full of academics. I reached my hand down and forcefully pushed his hand away. He then turned to me and said ""are you going to stay here"", and I said ""yes, I am"". He looked disappointed. He again touched my rear end and jammed his thumb between my buttocks. Again I pushed it away forcefully. At this stage he got up from the table. I was terrified and wanted to leave, but it would have meant walking back to my nearby hotel, and I was scared that he would follow me to my hotel. I looked around and realized that all of the colleagues in the room whom I knew well were male, and I didn't want to ask one of them to walk with me back to the hotel because I thought that would sound weird. I didn't feel I knew any of them well enough to tell them what had happened. I was scared. I leaned over to the woman (whom I did not know) across from me at the table and began engaging her in conversation about her research, hoping that the man had left, and I could wait a while then walk back to my hotel. Unfortunately, he came back with another drink and sat next to me. He discreetly tried to touch me on my rear end and jam his thumb up me a few more times. I pushed his hand away and kept talking to the woman across from me, trying not to pay him any attention. He got up and went to the bathroom, then came back, sat down one more time, and asked me again if I was going to stay there or if I wanted to leave. I said I was going to stay there. He looked visibly annoyed, and after another minute or so, got up, announced he was leaving, and walked out. My heart was racing. I still didn't want to leave on my own in case he was hanging around outside the bar. So I decided I would stay there and wait until some of the group that I knew headed back to the hotel where we were staying. I continued to try to engage in conversation with the people around me, but I was almost shaking with fear. I had never been assaulted like this before, and I was in shock that someone had tried to do this in a professional setting, in a crowded room full of colleagues. Eventually, people started to leave, and I walked back to my hotel with two male colleagues that I knew well, quickly locking myself into my hotel room to break down and cry. My flight was the next day, and I stayed in my hotel room until the last possible moment I needed to leave to go to the airport, terrified that I might see this man again. Once I was home, I broke down, hysterically crying, and explained to my husband what had happened. I felt so unsafe, so violated, and so discouraged for a long time. I purposefully avoided the city where the event took place for the next two years, avoiding going to any conferences or seminars there. The man didn't even live in that city or state, but I was traumatized by what had happened there. I received an email from the man about a week after the incident, sent to my institutional email address. He said that he had had too much to drink and he apologized for anything inappropriate that he said or did. I was disgusted even seeing an email from him, and immediately deleted it. I never told any of my academic colleagues about the incident. I was scared at the time that accusations might be made that it was inappropriate for us to be in a bar drinking, even though it was a group situation and I had started out the evening thinking everything was professional and above board. I didn't know what to do. I was scared people would not believe me or take me seriously. Also, he was at a different university, and the incident had occurred at an out of town conference. Even if I had wanted to report the incident, I didn't know if I should talk to my university, his, or the conference organization where the incident had taken place. About a year later, I did a university survey on bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace. I responded that yes, I had been sexually harassed, but I did not give any further details. The university did not follow up with me on my response. This is the first time I've recounted what happened at length. My heart is racing even now, 5 years later, as I write about it. I have never felt such helplessness as I did that night. And it has changed the way I interact with colleagues at academic conferences and in my academic workplace. I am wary of everyone, and I put up a wall so that conversations don't get too in depth about anything. That's a shame, because I'm probably missing out on some great opportunities to connect with new colleagues. It gets better with time, though, and I am slowly learning to trust again that I can have a professional conversation in a professional setting with a man in my profession without the possibility of being sexually assaulted.

The most traumatizing experience for me, personally, was being threatened with some sort of vague legal action after I posted a facebook comment about gender discrimination in my department. I was called into my Chair's office and berated for what felt like an hour (called a ""trouble-maker,"" ""mean-spirited,"" wrong, etc.). Other female colleagues had similar experiences. This year a sexual harassment claim was filed against the (now former) Chair; most of us are entirely unsurprised by this. In fact, we're surprised there's only one (though another student has apparently come forward).

This professor knew the name of every female in his group, no matter how junior, but rarely remembered or payed attention to any of the male students, no matter how senior.

129,"As a young assistant professor at an art school I noticed an older adjunct faculty member who would lurk in the halls or appear out of nowhere and stare. Other colleagues agreed he was ""creepy."" Fast forward 10 years. I was now department chair and it came to my attention that this same guy, who taught poetry writing, was making female undergraduates pretty uncomfortable. Rather than teaching everyone together in a classroom, he held tutorials in his tiny office with the door closed so that he could work with each individual student on her writing. One student came forward when she received an envelope of poems at her home address (which she had not shared with him -- he had gotten the registrar to tell him where she lived). Although he would deny it, the poems were highly suggestive and personal, mentioning, for example, a tattoo on her leg and the street she lived on. He also called her on her cell phone and asked her questions about her boyfriend. He would have students bring some of their art to class so he could help them translate their inspiration into words; in her case he honed in on a photograph in which she appeared in the background, in the shadows, partly nude. (This was in that tiny office with the door closed.) The student filed a complaint, and I had her taken out of the class and asked another colleague to work with her through the rest of the semester so that she could get credit for the course. This was just the first incident. This student filed a complaint which was adjudicated through a complex system that included both the in-house sexual harassment procedure and the state-wide faculty union grievance process. His defense was that he was working very hard with each student to draw out their creative energy based on what he saw in their work, and of course, they explored all kinds of subjects in their work. The fact that they were 20 years old and he was somewhere in his 70s, supposedly mature enough to know where to draw the line, did not seem to register. He had several advocates in the department, all male and quite senior to me, who argued that his writing poems for the students was a matter of free speech, and that stopping it would cast a shadow over the principles of artistic freedom at the school. The poet was able to keep his job with a stern warning, an order not to have students in his office alone, and a remedial sexual harassment training program -- something required by state law that had not really been enforced for adjunct faculty, putting the university in a position of potential liability. He came to my office in the fall and told me he was very sorry, he now understood, and I would never have any trouble with him again. I told him I hoped he meant it. But of course he kept up the same behavior, choosing new students for his obsession each term. After the students saw that he had not been fired, they were very reluctant to bring new complaints against him, and feeling very upset that I had not been able to get justice for the first student, I did not feel I could push them to complain, as I could make no promises. I could only take the incident to the civil rights officer, but without a formal complaint we could go no further. Every time I went to him and told him I knew what he was up to, he wanted to know who complained, and whined about how he had a constitutional right to face his accuser. He denied and denied, and begged me not to take away the only meaningful thing left in his life. After a couple of these incidents he seems to have understood he couldn't do this with students in his class, but decided it would be ok to stalk random students he saw in the halls. Two years after my term was up, he turned his attention to a graduate student, followed her to the cafeteria, invited himself to have lunch with her, offered to help her with recommendations, etc. She didn't like it but she felt she had to be polite to a professor. Then he wrote a little play and e-mailed it to her. There was immediately a second e-mail saying ""maybe you shouldn't open that other e-mail but just delete it."" Naturally she opened it. It was very explicit. She brought it to public safety, who called HR, and at last he was escorted out of the building and banned from campus.

He would openly in front of others express his love for me, describing that he felt about me the same love and attraction as he did for his wife when he first met her. Seeing me, even from afar, would lead to his coming my way to hug me, compliment my looks, my attire, my smile. He would refer to me as his very own Greek goddess. He would call me to meetings in his office to tell me his personal problems and seek my care of him, which when I did not give, made me pursue me all the more fiercely. He declared he needed to be a student in my class to learn from me, and attended every class session for my first semester. He would challenge most everything I said in class. After class, he would stand with his groin in my face as I sat in a deskchair talking with students after class. He would block me from getting out of the chair, so that he could keep his dick close to my mouth. One time as I was bending over to pick up my bag, he ran to the front of the room to put his dick in my face so that when I stood up, my face made contact with his entire crotch. I reported each incident to colleagues and my Dean. I was told to ignore him, as he is mentally ill. I was told he is harmless and that I should laugh it off. I was told that nothing he did was really going to harm my professional development because I was so smart and capable of rising above. When I continued to demand an end to his contact with me, and secured a lawyer, the institution finally put in writing that he is not to be my department chair any  more, that he is to stop attending my class, that he is to have no contact with me, that he is not to address me. All this triggered his fury and his behavior became dangerous. He announced to students that he was divorcing me, and posted a sign on his door that because of my hostility towards him, and University invasiveness, that his liberties are being taken away. Students would laugh and joke about it in front of me. They would tease me to take him back because he was so brokenhearted. They reported he would take up regular class time describing his anger towards me as the divorce proceeded. He made regular derogatory comments about me and anything I contributed as an idea during faculty meetings. He wrote a private letter for my tenure file that was later described to me by members of the t & p committee as pages long, filled with hateful descriptions of my incompetence, and that ""couldn't have been crazier if it had been written in crayon."" Private letters were eliminated from tenure review processes shortly after this episode. The harassment lasted a total of six years, until he was took an early retirement option.

Rather than dropping me off (which would have seemed pretty normal), he escorted me to the check in desk, collected my room key for me, then took my suitcase from me and walked it to the elevator.

On the second floor, I practically had to run after him (he, still dragging my luggage), and thought surely he'd have to hand over my room key at the door... Wrong again. He entered my room, walked my bag over to the bedside table, and began scribbling something on the pad next to the bed: his phone number, in case I needed to reach him, he said. For what felt like an eternity, he stood there in the room looking at me in silence, until I stuck my arm straight out to shake his hand uncomfortably.

I confronted him by saying that I thought he would want to know that grad students were buzzing with gossip about his exploits and the student he was sleeping with at the time would come to class and tell people all about what they had been up to. When I spoke to him, he looked and the ground and said, ""Thanks"" -- then he cut me off professionally, never to speak to me again. He  broke up with this particular student shortly after my confrontation and used my name *while he was still inside of her* in a post-coital ""this isn't working out"" move. He would go on to sleep with several other students while I was in school (and after). This behavior established a value system that confused the metrics for ""good work,"" created competition between women that had nothing to do with the program or our education, and normalized predatory behavior. Of course he has been promoted several times and never held accountable even though his antics are widely known. 

2011: My advisor commented on my breasts in a meeting about my thesis. This was part of a comment  he was making about why he didn't understand that the professor who slept with students was seeing/interested in a friend/colleague of mine who, according to my advisor was less attractive than me ""because [my] breasts [we]re so much larger than hers"". This was completely unprompted, of course. 

2011-2013 I started dating a man who was a year ahead of me in my grad program who serially harassed my friends by constantly crossing boundaries, not accepting no for an answer, and groping them (sometimes in front of me, sometimes not) while we were together. Of course this means that he harassed me, too. We were together for about six months when he moved to the east coast to attend a PhD program from which he was expelled for groping a woman's genitals at an off campus party. Because they were both in the same PhD program, she was able to levy charges. The University suspended him, and after the term was up they took away his funding, but did not require him to leave the program. He quit when the money ran out. During this time of crisis, he turned to me to perform the emotional labor of supporting him without revealing all of the details of what had gone down. After a couple of years, he moved back to where I lived and began adjuncting at the institution where we met. Not only did the faculty support him during his suspension (he reached out to the professor who slept with students to ask for advice), but they hired him back to work in their department knowing fell well of his transgressions, the charges filed, and his 'fall from grace' in the PhD program he moved across the country to attend.",Humanities,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,500

It developed into specific comments (So-and-So must have hit on you when you were working at X (other) site) and suggestions about exercises I could perform in order to, for example, improve my bust (his word, not mine). All of the comments came when no one else was within hearing distance. He would make ""jokes"" about being heartbroken and suicidal that I wouldn't follow him home and would hold my writing implements hostage so I would have to talk to him in order to get them back (I avoided him otherwise). He carved my name onto an ancient artifact (HIGHLY inappropriate, regardless of what you carve on there). I spoke with the site director about my discomfort and he spoke with the Offender, but things escalated. He kept asking me for drinks after dinner and, during a social event, pressed his body against mine and only backed off when a (male) colleague entered the scene. Finally I addressed the issue with the Offender myself, at which point he told me that I only said I was uncomfortable because I felt threatened in my authority in MY trench I asked for clarification on this comment three times, to be sure that I didn't misunderstand him. He said that, yes, he did not believe I was actually uncomfortable with his behavior and comments, only that I felt like he was ""taking over"" in my trench. He assured me repeatedly that he would ""let"" me retain authority, I could calm down.  I was furious and cried on site, but he remained working on site, in my trench, for the remainder of the season. ",Natural sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,368
185,"I was walking to class with the professor and the other TA when he decided to tell us about his sexual exploits at a different university. (He loved the concrete walls because it meant he could have sex in his office.) I said EW, the other TA said nothing. I think it was a test to see if either one of us was interested.",Humanities,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,64

187,"My friend told me the harasser engaged in aggressive courting, heavy charm & manipulation immediately after he met her.  Then he became emotionally abusive & would psychologically torture her.  She thought this was his cycle. He would brag about having sex on his desk w/grad students.  She said he has a 'reputation.'  I saw his picture online. Meh.

188,"My MA supervisor insisted that we review and discuss my MRP at his apartment. At first I didn’t mind, but then he started calling me everyday to ask if I could come over so we could do some more edits. Sometimes he would order dinner and insist I stay and eat with him. After I defended and graduated my MA program, I decided to apply for a PhD program at another university which upset him. When applying for funding for this program, he refused to provide me with a reference letter unless I came over and we worked on my application together. 2 years later and from time to time he still calls or emails me.

189,"I was on a leadership committee for a scholars program. The managing faculty member had a graduate student assistant. The graduate student got my phone number from the committee list and proceeded to call and text me repeatedly, asking for a romantic relationship. I declined. He told me he would wait for me. I told him not to. He continued to text me and harass me in person.",Natural sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,68
190,"My advisor said he decided to mentor me—including offering an independent study—because I have such a ""nice smile.""

192,"I was a first-year MA student standing in the hallway of our academic building (looking at a bulletin board) when one of my professors came up next to me, asked how I was doing, and put his arm around my waist/hip and pulled me close to him.

193,"I was groped at a conference, during an evening off-site event. 
(specifically, I was standing next to a food truck by the beach, which was across the road from the conference hotel in Gulfport.)

The harasser sidled up next to me as I talked to someone else and then tried to grab my butt and then my breasts. I faked a phone call to get away from him.  ",Humanities,Multiple,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,69
194,"I was meeting with a professor in my graduate program who acted as a mentor to me. It was my first semester or second in the program. I always sat on a couch in his office while he sat in his desk chair, but this time he got up to sit next to me on the couch. I was talking traveling to a nearby town, and he was explaining how to get there since I was new in town. He touched two spots on my thigh as a ""point A"" and ""point B"" to describe the route I should take.",Humanities,Other Type of School,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,100

I was told how many women do not return to their pre-baby body status shortly after I returned from a maternity leave that I had to fight to have and congratulated for getting my pre-baby body back. Numerous jokes have been made regarding my breastfeeding status and need for ""pump breaks.""

2. I was told that I would not have trouble finding a job because I'm pretty.

3. I've been touched on the lower back and thighs by male colleagues.", Social sciences,Research Institute,Other,Graduate Student,Faculty,79
196,"Touched repeatedly in a professor's office. He asked if I wanted to go out for a drink that night or any future night. He suggested regular meetings in the evening in his office or out for drinks. When I declined these invitations, he gave me a C on a term paper. The other professor of the class (it was a team-taught class) reversed the grade when I showed him the paper. I did not tell the other professor what had transpired.",Humanities,Elite Institution,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,81
197,"There's a retired English professor at my church. He's in choir with me. Wanted to talk to me a lot because he heard I was a PhD student. Asked me to go with him to the symphony. I initially assented, but something didn't feel right, so I canceled. Later, upon hearing that it was my birthday, he blocked my way out of the choir loft, so that he could hug me for far too long, and make a very strange comment about my age. I joked about it on facebook. My priest saw and told me that I should report it to her; she said that he had been kicked out of a church across town for similarly inappropriate behavior. After I spoke with her, he didn't grab me, but he would do things like block my way out of the choir loft when we went down for communion.",Humanities,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,149
198,"There have been so many things that happened. One is my senior faculty colleague in the office next door to me. He stares at my chest whenever we talk. I have heard that he does this to other women in the department, and that some have considered making formal complaints. But no one has complained officially.",Natural sciences,Research Institute,Male,Faculty,Graduate Student,56
199,"I didn't consider this a form of harassment exactly at the time, yet my thoughts have returned to it many times in recent weeks; the degree to which we all took it as more or less normal seems to me illustrative of how bad normal has been. A fellow graduate student was working in the department's main research center (a title VI funded area studies center). He was always an arrogant, somewhat unpleasant, self-righteous type (and evangelical Christian no less, relevant because of the hypocrisy). One day the (female) director entered the center, a space always open to the public and students (both undergrad and grad), not at all a private office, and there was the grad student in question, on the clock supposed to be working, but instead masturbating to porn right there at his work computer in a public university office. The box of tissues he was careful to keep by the computer took on a whole new connotation, as did the crusty stains on the chair that other grad students were forced to sit in as well as they worked their shifts in the center. The director then found that the computer was filled with porn; it seemed that this is what he did for most of his 'working' hours. He was dismissed from his work-study job in the center BUT that's absolutely all that happened. No other form of rebuke or consequences at all. He continued in the program, continued to work with undergraduates, continued in his seminars with all of us, while several of his fellow graduate students continued to have to sit in the weirdly stained chair he left behind in the center. He took the rebuke so lightly, had so little shame, that he asked for his job back at the center the next year, apparently thinking that his perpetual masturbation in a public university office while on the clock really wasn't such a big deal. They didn't give him the job back, but that's the extent of negative consequence. He graduated and now holds a tenure track position at a different university. I see him at conferences regularly and often wonder, how does he interact with his undergraduates? And how is it that none of us thought to question whether this was a person who should be in a position of power vis-a-vis young vulnerable women? Or, rather, of course we questioned, but it never once occurred to us that we could do anything about it. After all, the administration knew already and did all but nothing. The fact that I'm still questioning, was this harassment? As if there should be any question that we all had a right to not be exposed to this guy's masturbation practices while at work, to not worry about seeing his erect penis while going about our work day, to not have to sit on the crusted remnants of semen he left behind....I write this and it sounds graphic, but in fact it's merely descriptive.
