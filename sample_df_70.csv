0,"Three different incidents in three different Canadian universities as I worked towards my doctorate in Englisht Language and Literature.  The first involved several approaches by a professor to join his ""groupies"" to share wine and literary discussion.  I believe one or more of my peers became his paramour and I was a distinct outsider for not joining in.  Their marks were quite high!
The second was more serious and involved being stalked by a professor in the department who made several attempts to get in to my apartment accompanied by compliments and then pleas to pursue a relationship and which was only stopped by threats of exposure by my fellow student and myself. Interestingly, while he was not one of my profs, his best friend gave me the lowest mark in the class (all my other marks were in the ""A"" range.)
The third incident may have cost me a position as an assistant professor when I  rejected the advances  of one of the professors on the hiring committee who had invited me into his office after the interview.   This included removing his hand from my knee.",Humanities,Multiple,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,192
1,"About 13 yrs ago, I shared an office with a well-known, middle-aged professor, who occasionally taught in the department. It started with complaints about his marriage. And I was appalled by overtly sexist things he would say to female undergraduates during office hours, eg ""did your boyfriend help you with this?"" By Feb, he began to kiss the top of my head when exiting the office. Then, one day, he kissed my neck with an open mouth.

Many other grad students told me that they felt similarly harassed by him.", Social sciences,Elite Institution,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,89
2,"When I was a first-year grad student, I was harassed anonymously by email by a postdoc in my lab group. He would make references to conversations we had earlier in the day so I knew it was him, but used a throwaway account so I had no proof. I was the only female member in my lab group and the youngest student at the time.",Formal sciences,Elite Institution,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,65
3,"A renowned, tenured male faculty member who sits on a board I serve on in grad student capacity is aggressively huggy during greetings; it is nearly impossible to avoid.

I know of corroborated incidences from six other women graduate students.",Natural sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,57
4,"As an undergrad, during a critique of my work, when I was 19. We were discussing a group of photographs I had made. Some were self portraits, NONE were sexual, or even provocative in nature, and there was zero nudity. If anything, they were an attempt to grapple with my own poor self image and ideas of my inner narrative expressed outwardly. Near the end of the critique the professor (who was a known lech) said of one of the self portraits ""and this one, it's like, it's like I can FEEL your vagina."" My classmates looked at me as I turned red and fell silent. It took a few days for the fucked-upness of what he'd said to sink in. This was in 1998 or so, the internet was not then what it is now. I couldn't tweet about it, there were no online sexual harassment forms to fill out. And I didn't feel I had the agency to share this or report it to anyone. I felt like it was one of those things you just had to put up with, just part of ""being a woman"" in the world. It wasn't my first lesson in dealing with creeps, but it was one of the only ones that existed within a specific power structure, like school, and where I experienced blatant abuse of privilege and power by a man. It still makes me angry and ashamed 20 years later. ",Humanities,Regional College,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,242
5,"I used to volunteer in a virology lab in 2012. Postdoc was not helpful...belittled my work, told me to do something, then it would go wrong, then he would blame me for it when I followed his instructions to the letter. Postdoc would flirt heavily with two other girls in the lab. There was one in particular that would work at the same times as me, and sometimes I witnessed inappropriate behavior (he would touch her breast or hug her, she would protest and move away uncomfortably, he would laugh, she would giggle in awkwardness). I felt bad for the girl because she was an international student and clearly did not like the attention. One time it got to me and I asked her if she was ok after an ""encounter"" with the postdoc. She was nervous but did not want to cause a scene. I left after about 1.5 years. It was an utter waste of time, I learned nothing. When I initially joined I had of course been promised publications but never got on any, and when I mentioned how I was disappointed, of course the postdoc said that it was due to my poor quality of work. A few months later, I get a call from the Title 9 officer at my university saying that the Postdoc had been accused of sexual harassment by 3 other girls (besides the two that worked with me). She asked if I had been a victim. I said no, I had not, but I witnessed it happening to the international student and that I felt like my time at the lab had been poorly spent. Nothing happened to the guy, obviously. I got an insincere apology from the Title 9 officer and the university covered their behinds. That was it.",Natural sciences,Elite Institution,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,299
6,"At a department gathering, I wore a skirt and the first thing a male prof said to me was that he “appreciated being able to see my legs.” One of the only other times I’ve worn a skirt he made a similar comment about in the hallway outside his office. There was also a sense among women graduate students that he was prone to inappropriate comments, a rumor that he had an affair with a grad student, and he would often talk about his marriage in inappropriate settings.  

A different professor in the same department told me to serve a visiting scholar coffee at our weekly coffee clatch. I organized the coffee with a male grad student who was also there, but of course he didn’t ask my friend to serve the other scholar. I declined. The same professor introduced my writing partner and I, who work on women and gender, at a small conference hosted by our department. The previous few papers had been about animals, and he said “So, speaking of animals, our next paper is [title of paper that included the word women].”",Humanities,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Chair/Dean/Head,187
7,"Male professor made several comments over the course of the semester about women being intellectually inferior. On one of my assignments, his comment was, “Your writing is lively and engaging, too bad you don’t know how to think.” Near the end of the semester, I had to give a presentation for the class. The screen wasn’t lowered completely when I began to speak, so he interrupted me, and told me to fix it. I walked over toward him and had to bend over quite low in my nice presentation dress to yank the screen the rest of the way down. He said, “Oh, I wish I could get women to do that more often.” I didn’t see his gesture, but apparently he was swooning over my rear end in front of the (almost entirely male) rest of the class.",Humanities,Regional College,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,139
8,"Sexism worst when pregnant. Most appalling was when male colleague whom I had just met hugged me extremely tightly IN A CLOSED ELEVATOR. I was frozen with fear. Also during my national association’s conference my very senior, male panel chair introduced me as “being busy on a new project - making babies” - the male audience twittered - this after I had put the panel together and explicitly sent detailed bio info. Also various comments from university colleagues during Dept. meetings about being “ready to pop” etc. Oh and this gem - former PhD supervisor called me a “producer of babies” and said mothers couldn’t be scholars. No harassment whatsoever at any time from students or female colleagues  - always senior male men. Remember: harassment exists to police the boundaries of the profession. Always be vigilant.

9,"When I was an Assistant Professor, my Department Head was frequently just too close physically.  Then he started winking at me during faculty meetings.  It was humiliating.

10,"An assistant professor (not my advisor) slept with two of his undergraduate students, to the detriment of his graduate students. One of his grad students ended up leaving, in part because he would prioritize these students over her, blowing of their meetings to go on dates with the students.  This professor would also make really inappropriate comments about another professor and her child, all while professing to be an ally and advocate.  In more minor incidents that have happened to me directly, my academic siblings would touch me inappropriately at parties or have conversations with my breasts.  I had a collaborator spend way too much time talking to me about my outfit, rather than my science.",Natural sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,119

I needed a database designed to record responses to a survey I administered, and my advisor directed me to the manager of a division of the Center he ran, which employed a technician who was available to do these kind of supplemental technology policy. When I spoke with the manager about my project needs and how to contact the technician, he explained that the previous technician had graduated and the new one wouldn't start until after the summer ended. Ergo, there was no one on staff to help with my project. However, he added, because the new technician has already been hired and was another (male) graduate student who I knew, I ""could probably work something out"" (said with a wink and grin) to get my project work done. It was disgusting and uncomfortable. ",Humanities,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,144
12,"A grad student tried to rape another grad student in a hotel during a conference. He disregarded the fact that she already had a partner when he was coming on to her as well as the fact that she is queer and had no interest in him for multiple reasons. The department took no action against this student. He went on to win an award and get a tenure-track job. One of the most disturbing parts is that his research is about doing ethnographic research on incarcerated juvenile girls, so who knows what kinds of disturbing access he has to this vulnerable population and what types of things he may have tried to do. Also, the chair of the department was female yet was complicit in allowing his attempted rape to go completely unchecked. Meanwhile, the woman he tried to rape suffered severe mental health repercussions.", Social sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,146
13,"I have never personally been harassed or assaulted by anyone in my department. However, I would definitely say that my department and my graduate student colleagues have certainly contributed to a hostile work environment within the department. When I entered, the graduate cohort definitely felt like a ""boys club"" where the students with the most power were men, and their behavior fueled socializing and hierarchies in the department. Most of their socializing consisted of drinking and taking drugs until losing all control of themselves. It was not uncommon for them to exposing themselves at parties and even public places like bars.", Social sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,101

In particular, from September 2014 onwards, the former chair, a popular and influential personality on campus, engaged habitually in inappropriate, predatory and disrespectful conduct. During this time, I received numerous emails (even during my summer breaks in India), text messages and voice mails asking me to join him for either lunch, coffee or go kayaking with him. Once he had unexpectedly entered my lecture room, minutes before class was to begin, and asked me out for drinks; another time he wanted to go grocery shopping for me. Over the years, I endured his 'bad behavior' that included being intimidated by him twice on the road to work, and being pointedly informed by him that his brother was a parole officer. He also delayed the publication of my monograph, contracted with one of the leading international publishers in my field. The times we did go for lunch, they felt like dates more than meetings.

A graphic design professor would address female peers in my class (including myself) as ""woman."" A full-time staff member at the school texted a student to tell her about his crush on her among other uncomfortable things. He was her boss and she was an undergraduate student-worker. A full-time professor in the film/video department would tell students about his home-life (including his unhappiness with his marriage), would drink and get high in front of students, and went so far as to begin harassing a student online and through texts/calls. He would ask students not to tell anyone about these moments. He often took students out drinking, especially on trips. A professor in graphic design was caught staring down a girl's shirt and caught mumbling under his breath, ""There is a God.""

16,"First, let me say that I'm a male. While I know that around 10% of all sexual harassment incidents involve men as the victims, I think it is important for all to know that this happens to people of all identities.

While I was in graduate school at a major, private university, one of my male, professors would regularly make physical contact with me (kissing me, sticking his tongue in my ear, etc.). He was openly flirtatious with all but would become much more aggressive in private. I felt as if I had no choice but to allow this due to his status and power over my career and, at times, I felt like it might be something that was allowing me to remain in the program. This continued even after I concluded classes as I felt like I needed him as a reference.

I look back now in disgust at what he did but I fully remember the feeling that I had no choice but to submit. I think about this every day now that I'm a professor myself and wield the same power over grad students at a major university.

17,"In 2014-2015, a female colleague and friend (then a graduate student) became involved in a secret, polyamorous relationship with another female graduate student and a male adjunct faculty member. Technically, this relationship was in violation of the university's sexual conduct policies, as the adjunct faculty member taught in the graduate students' department. The relationship turned unhealthy when the male partner began to play each of the female partners against each other. Ultimately, my friend (who also lives with bipolar disorder) despaired and committed an act of self-harm. Though she recovered and remained active in the program, my friend's action brought the previously secret relationship to the attention of other graduate students in the department. However, my friend's female and male former partners both actively sought to maintain the relationship's secrecy by harassing and threatening other graduate students who inquired about the relationship and/or offered my friend support. The former partners successfully recruited some graduate students to their ""side,"" which created a stilted he-said/she-said/she-said dynamic. My friend, out of a combination of fear of drawing further departmental attention to herself and of potential reprisals from her former partners, insisted that none of this behavior be reported officially. At the time, I agreed out of respect for her wishes; I have come to regret this decision. In the end, the events were an open secret, as the entire graduate student body in the department became embroiled in the affair. One graduate student -- who bore the brunt of the female and male partners' harassment and bullying because of her advocacy on my friend's behalf -- left the program the following year.",Humanities,Elite Institution,Other,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,269
18,"At my first meeting with the course director of the class I was going to teach at my new institution - at my first academic job after a one-year postdoc - the male course director addressed me and the other new lecturer (a male grad student with no experience in the material or even in teaching at all) as if the male grad student would know what to do, and as if I was brand new (I had taught the material in three courses in the past). He ignored me, except when he turned to me to complain that the course was going downhill because ""nowadays there have to be black lesbians on every syllabus"" because of political correctness. This course had no black lesbians on the syllabus (in fact, no women writers at all, and hardly any modern texts). I am a white, straight, middle-class woman and was surprised at this remark. He then went back to ignoring me, addressing all his comments about teaching the Iliad and classical literature to the male grad student entirely. Until he suddenly focused on me, exclaiming: ""what am I thinking, we have a woman with us today. We should talk about Helen of Troy and her sexuality!"" I wasn't sure how to respond, but it was clear he wanted me to talk about sexuality in some form, which I didn't. After that, he went back to ignoring me, which he continued doing for pretty much the entire semester. I'm not sure he ever realized that I had some teaching experience with the texts and had resources to share, and that the poor grad student had no experience whatsoever.

19,"I was a male grad student who witnessed this behavior by a male professor toward female undergrads. The students and professors in my program had a lot of informal social interaction, with clear lines and behavioral standards of course. One professor would attend parties with the undergrads and get inappropriately drunk and dance with or become handsy/close/etc with the students. To my knowledge he never assaulted anyone but I would watch him act extremely inappropriately, and the female undergrads could see exactly what was happening and were VERY weirded out by it. Several female students told me stories of being made to feel extremely uncomfortable/threatened personally by his behavior at past events as well, in this same manner. This happened about twice per semester, if not more.  

That this professor, then and now, taught a required course that all undergrads in the major have to take, and some of them have to be dragged kicking and screaming to take it seriously. (I on the other hand LOVE this material.) This guy's behavior and reputation definitely pushed many students away from taking this particular field of study seriously, which deeply upsets me. 

I will also add that several of the other grad students he worked with - before, during, and after my time - are distinctly similar in their approach to undergrads, and one of them started dating an undergrad while in his PhD program, which I felt weird about. I hate to think this professor is producing more people like him to sprinkle around the landscape in our field.   ",Humanities,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,263

I was denied employment opportunities for which I was not only qualified but the only candidate who was qualified. I am blackballed to this day in the local employment market.

Other students and professors continued the party. Other students told me he got even more touchy. At the end of the night, he was masturbating with his hand in his pants in front/near the students.

After  a pause, he added ""You'll have to come and answer questions no essays possible for you."" On the day of the exam, he was talking for an hour and a half and told me about a movie that had a blow job reference in it. That happened on a Saturday evening when everyone had already left.

The professor self identified as a lesbian, and would talk about her sexuality in mildly inappropriate ""joking"" ways in class and in office hours to ""test the water"" with individual students, even though she was in a committed long term relationship. She would often ask us about our sexual relationships with other women, and if two of us talked to each other outside class and she saw us, she'd assume we were sleeping together and would question us about it. The worst remarks I recall her making in class were when she joked about ""pimping us all out,"" going so far as to name the nearby street where she envisioned turning us out as prostitutes. Most of us laughed nervously, a few people rolled their eyes or murmured in protest. She pretended these were ""just jokes"" but it was clearly giving her pleasure to abuse her power in this way--she enjoyed making us feel uncomfortable. She harassed the straight women in class incessantly. When she found out I was queer she backed off a little on me--I think she was afraid that if a queer woman reported her for sexual harassment it would have more weight. She didn't harass the other out queer woman in class much either.

40,"During my time in undergrad I worked under an incredible scientist for two years. He was very kind and intelligent. I didn't interact with him much, however, because he had been battling a serious illness since before I began working for him. Towards the end of my time in lab I received an email under his name (but a different address than usual) with the subject line ""I'm dying, need your love."" In the email he professed his love for me, saying he wanted to leave his wife for me and that I couldn't tell anyone. As my advisor, he held my future in his hands... My heart sank; I was so uncomfortable and I didn't know what to do. Neither did my boyfriend, who also worked in the lab and had another year left of school. I spoke with another female undergrad in my lab and she received a similar email the week before. She sent it to some department at the university that was supposed to handle those kinds of issues and recommended I did the same. I did, but never heard back about the incident. They never investigated or responded to my email. My labmate had a feeling it was sent by the postdoc who had recently been fired. He preyed on us as female students in an attempt to get my advisor fired. My advisor kept his position (I'm glad, he was a good man and that email was out of character) but died from his illness a few years later. It's sickening that the postdoc used us as pawns to try to end my advisor's career.

He soon after changed our planned early evening meeting at his office to a bar downtown, the site of a nude photo exhibit at the time. I declined the meeting. I told two close colleagues about my concerns and they minimized them, saying that he treated students like family members so lines were blurred and he just did things differently.

He invited me to a party at his house and to my relief left. Later I learned that I was the only grad student invited to that party. Of course I didn't go. I also heard that he was asking other grad students for my address - no one would give it to him though because I was not the only female graduate student that he harassed.  Everyone knew that he was trouble for female grad students. Eventually someone turned him in and the school was looking in to the situation. He was not hired as an adjunct instructor after graduation and was told to leave the university. I was very bothered because he had talked about his female students in a sexual way.

Mentor often referenced his own sex life with his wife, made flirtatious comments to women mentees about his desire to pursue a relationship with them, and commented on the physical attractiveness and bodies of these mentees and other women in public spaces.

This made me very uncomfortable. The ex professor's friend called me 10+ times a day asking me to introduce him to girls in my university but I told both of them that no girl is interested (I did not ask any women). The ex-prof then told me that his friend thinks ""I am the hottest"", and soon the friend started asking me to sleep with him, started soliciting me for sex.

I have a friend from a different university who has had a similar experience with this professor- he tried to do the same thing with her. I wish I had the courage to say No from the start.

At the end of the evening our male friend suddenly dashes off and everyone else leaves, leaving us girls alone with SG.

53,"I took a temporary research technician position in a cell biology lab in 2012, fresh out of college. Shortly after being hired, the PI began sexualizing me; looking down my shirt when talking to me, not taking me seriously as a scientist, very obviously 'checking me out.' The senior-most research assistant told me that the boss had deliberately scheduled my interview for a day when the research asst wasn't there, as research asst had been warning off people (especially young women) from taking this job. I was then informed that he had a history of harassing undergrads and similar aged employees and was regaled with stories of his highly inappropriate behavior, including why they no longer had evening lab outings due to his inappropriateness. The boss continued to act inappropriately towards me as well as being abusive towards myself and other lab members so I avoided him as much as possible. His approach to science and grant-based research was also suspect at best. During a lunch time holiday outing, he played with my hair and told me I looked like a Disney princess. I was extremely concerned with looking like a 'job hopper' but finally left after 9 months and on my last day, he was nowhere to be found. I left with the research asst and then boss called research asst and proceeded to rant about ""how much he had done for that bitch, how dare she just leave without saying goodbye, etc."" while I was in the car. I know there were at least 3-4 other undergrads/techs that he had been inappropriate with and most of the senior most members of the lab were aware of how he was, as well as whoever was on his tenure committee. It was an open secret to a large degree and there was a 'whisper network' for new graduate students to not join his lab, but this didn't help technicians like myself who were underpaid and generally couldn't just transfer labs.

I was flattered that he thought ""highly"" enough of me to share these confidences and to be so honest with me - and as a clergy person, I was easily drawn in to his need to disclose and share his ""troubles.""  This ultimately led to a sexual relationship while at a conference in England - after my dissertation was turned in, but before my defense.
