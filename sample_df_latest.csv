952,"As a young assistant professor at an art school I noticed an older adjunct faculty member who would lurk in the halls or appear out of nowhere and stare. Other colleagues agreed he was ""creepy."" Fast forward 10 years. I was now department chair and it came to my attention that this same guy, who taught poetry writing, was making female undergraduates pretty uncomfortable. Rather than teaching everyone together in a classroom, he held tutorials in his tiny office with the door closed so that he could work with each individual student on her writing. One student came forward when she received an envelope of poems at her home address (which she had not shared with him -- he had gotten the registrar to tell him where she lived). Although he would deny it, the poems were highly suggestive and personal, mentioning, for example, a tattoo on her leg and the street she lived on. He also called her on her cell phone and asked her questions about her boyfriend. He would have students bring some of their art to class so he could help them translate their inspiration into words; in her case he honed in on a photograph in which she appeared in the background, in the shadows, partly nude. (This was in that tiny office with the door closed.) The student filed a complaint, and I had her taken out of the class and asked another colleague to work with her through the rest of the semester so that she could get credit for the course. This was just the first incident. This student filed a complaint which was adjudicated through a complex system that included both the in-house sexual harassment procedure and the state-wide faculty union grievance process. His defense was that he was working very hard with each student to draw out their creative energy based on what he saw in their work, and of course, they explored all kinds of subjects in their work. The fact that they were 20 years old and he was somewhere in his 70s, supposedly mature enough to know where to draw the line, did not seem to register. He had several advocates in the department, all male and quite senior to me, who argued that his writing poems for the students was a matter of free speech, and that stopping it would cast a shadow over the principles of artistic freedom at the school. The poet was able to keep his job with a stern warning, an order not to have students in his office alone, and a remedial sexual harassment training program -- something required by state law that had not really been enforced for adjunct faculty, putting the university in a position of potential liability. He came to my office in the fall and told me he was very sorry, he now understood, and I would never have any trouble with him again. I told him I hoped he meant it. But of course he kept up the same behavior, choosing new students for his obsession each term. After the students saw that he had not been fired, they were very reluctant to bring new complaints against him, and feeling very upset that I had not been able to get justice for the first student, I did not feel I could push them to complain, as I could make no promises. I could only take the incident to the civil rights officer, but without a formal complaint we could go no further. Every time I went to him and told him I knew what he was up to, he wanted to know who complained, and whined about how he had a constitutional right to face his accuser. He denied and denied, and begged me not to take away the only meaningful thing left in his life. After a couple of these incidents he seems to have understood he couldn't do this with students in his class, but decided it would be ok to stalk random students he saw in the halls. Two years after my term was up, he turned his attention to a graduate student, followed her to the cafeteria, invited himself to have lunch with her, offered to help her with recommendations, etc. She didn't like it but she felt she had to be polite to a professor. Then he wrote a little play and e-mailed it to her. There was immediately a second e-mail saying ""maybe you shouldn't open that other e-mail but just delete it."" Naturally she opened it. It was very explicit. She brought it to public safety, who called HR, and at last he was escorted out of the building and banned from campus. The grievance procedure dragged on for over a year with his old friends declaiming over and over the violation of his civil rights, but the firing was upheld at last.",Chair of a large liberal arts department,Chair of a large liberal arts department,Adjunct professor,Male,Male,Art History,Other Type of School,Chair/Dean/Head,Faculty,Humanities
1312,"As an undergraduate, I took several classes with a professor who taught on a topic I enjoyed. He regularly gave me positive feedback on my work.  At some point, I asked him to become my advisor. At some point in my senior year, we went  out to lunch.  At the end of lunch, he told me his wife was out of town and asked if I wanted to come home with him for a martini. It was the middle of the day, on a weekday.

Over the years, I think I began to discount that memory, or my interpretation of it. Surely this full professor had not basically propositioned me when I was in college - I must have misremembered or imagined it.

Years later, as a postdoc, I ran into him at a conference that was being hosted at his institution (he had moved since I completed my undergrad). We briefly said hello, nothing more.

Later, when I landed a TT job, he reached out via email to congratulate me, and asked if I would be at a large conference that year. I was planning to attend, and was flattered that he was following my career.  I agreed to have dinner with him at the conference. We had dinner, and talked a great deal about my career trajectory.  He talked about his wife, and I talked about my partner of (at that time) 7 or 8 years, so there was no misunderstanding that we were both in committed relationships.  After dinner, he asked me up to his hotel room, which I politely declined.  As we said goodnight, he acted as if he would kiss me on the cheek.

1248,"Fall 2015, I started my PhD in a new program in the same college where I need received my masters. I was at an orientation get-together for new and current grad students at a local restaurant/bar. Only one prof showed up, but he was drunk, high, and disheveled when he showed up. I thought he was another grad student. 

I didn't chat much with him because I felt his presence, especially in the inebriated condition he was in, was inappropriate. It wasn't long before he made small talk, we discussed the upcoming semester, he assumed I was taking his philosophy course, but I hadn't told him I wasn't because I'd already had philosophy in my masters program. He asked how I felt about the program and I told him I thought I'd have a good time. He smirked, grabbed his beer, chuckled a bit, and said ""I'll make sure of it"" as he took a sip. 

I was so shocked, I sat there for 5 minutes trying to decide if I heard him correctly. My 14yo daughter was there so I got up and we left. The professor said ""see you in class"" and I told him I wouldn't be there. He was shocked and we left. 

I come from tech and am used to off-color comments, but for some reason, this threw me. After a few days I started taking to folks. One, a grad student who was friends with the prof tried to blow it off, ""he always says that, it is nothing!"" And I kept asking myself, and that student, since when does that excuse the behavior? 

Another grad student, male, described a situation where in the philosophy class I was not taking, he witnessed the prof being affectionate toward the female grad students, who happened to be primarily Asian. Then the Prof boasted of his sexual conquests with female Asian grad students in the past to my friend while walking to the bar for class (he held class in the local bars all the time). I was going to let his behavior toward me pass, 

I ended up calling a prof friend in my program and described this whole situation to her. She said they've had suspicion this was happening but no one willing to report it officially. So she suggested I go to the department chair and grad director. I did and they were very supportive and understanding, suggested I go to the Title IX office and file a complaint. It's worth noting that by this time i started feeling depressed.

I filed my report and the Title IX  office kept losing track of it's progress. Nearly six months later and they finally determined that the words the prof spoke we're harmless, he admitted to speaking them, and there was nothing to address other than to have a talk with him about how his words can be misinterpreted and require mandatory sexual harassment training as part of the grad school orientation program for this college. 

When the grad director for sat down with me to go over the report, he want nearly as supportive. Quite the opposite. When the topic of the sexual harassment training came up, the way he introduced it to me was ""now, because of you, we had to add an extra hour to the orientation program.""

There was no basis to his claim, and afterwards I was fully exonerated. Turns out the university was also investigating my advisor at the same time for a potential affair with his other student.

Finally, she latches on to graduate students who have children and forces herself upon the children (hugs, kisses, telling them to refer to her as ""Aunt [name].""

884,"Three different incidents in three different Canadian universities as I worked towards my doctorate in Englisht Language and Literature.  The first involved several approaches by a professor to join his ""groupies"" to share wine and literary discussion.  I believe one or more of my peers became his paramour and I was a distinct outsider for not joining in.  Their marks were quite high!
The second was more serious and involved being stalked by a professor in the department who made several attempts to get in to my apartment accompanied by compliments and then pleas to pursue a relationship and which was only stopped by threats of exposure by my fellow student and myself. Interestingly, while he was not one of my profs, his best friend gave me the lowest mark in the class (all my other marks were in the ""A"" range.)
The third incident may have cost me a position as an assistant professor when I  rejected the advances  of one of the professors on the hiring committee who had invited me into his office after the interview.   This included removing his hand from my knee.","Undergrad, MA candidate, PH. D.a.b.d.","Undergrad, MA candidate, PH.

905,"1. when i was an undergrad, my teacher (a phd candidate who was teaching the course) seduced me, and i let him.  it started with personal emails sent during the semester, followed by a request for an in-person meeting concerning feedback on my final paper (which i'm sure not all class participants were subjected to) and then later the same day, an email asking me on a date.  i went because i liked the attention; he made me feel smart and important, and i thought that he would help me if i continued to grad school in this academic field.  with time i have realized the power dynamics that were at play.  
2. when i was doing my masters degree, another phd candidate (who was auditing an MA course i was taking) began to aggressively harass me.  he would always make sure to sit next to me in the small class, which was distracting and made me feel very uncomfortable.  he would tell me false/negative rumours about my other male colleagues, i believe in an attempt to alienate me from them and to make himself seem superior.  at break and after class, he would corner me and force conversation, which veered between unwelcome flirtation and dismissive explanations of my own research topic.  he obtained my email address and used it to begin on-site harassing me, often emailing me about my appearance while we sat in class. i waited longer than i'd like to admit before reacting, because i was afraid of making an awkward situation in my first year of grad school, especially with someone in higher standing than me (phd vs. masters student).  eventually, after the messages became increasingly sexual, i told him (via email) that i wasn't interested and wanted to be left alone.  he responded with 5 or 6 emails sent in succession, accusing me of over-reacting, of being a bad feminist, and generally manipulating me into thinking that i owed him a second chance -- manipulation so effective that it almost worked, had it not been for my supportive cohort assuring me that he was completely out of line.  at the end of semester, i approached our (male) professor about the incident, as i knew i'd been hugely distracted by this all semester and would likely get a low grade as a result.  though i was  extremely nervous to bring this to the prof's attention (firstly because i am generally uncomfortable talking to profs/people in positions of authority, secondly because i found the whole situation to be very embarrassing and didn't want to admit any of it to him, and third because i thought he would think i was making it up for a higher grade).  after briefly laying out what had happened all semester and the different types harassment i had endured from the phd student, the professor's response was to thank me for not taking the matter to the administration.  i finished the class with my lowest grade received at the graduate level up until that point.",undergraduate and graduate,Undergraduate And Graduate,"two phd students, and one tenure professor who protected one of the phd students",Male,Male,Fine Arts;Film,Other Type of School,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,Humanities
