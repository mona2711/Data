We kept meeting every year and I would send him papers that he read very carefully and gave me great feedbacks. Then the last time we were supposed to meet, at Harvard after his conference (he lives in Israel so I thought I could make the trip to Boston, and I thought we we had become ""friend"" by then...he's around 75 years old so I trusted him) he suggested by email to meet him in his room because he ""had breakfast"" and that I could bring my bathing suit to take advantage of the hot tub.",Humanities,Multiple,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,126

4,"I was taking a French class and I was totally lost so I would always ask my professor for help. We would joke about pronunciations and grammar I would get wrong, but nothing ever outside the topic of French. After a few times talking to him, I guess he felt comfortable enough to tell me how another female student had reported him for sexual harassment. I listened but thought nothing of it, other than him just venting. Later, I was the last one to finish taking a test and I would always chew gum and blow bubbles when I would take tests; he told me he liked how I ""did that thing"" with the gum and it made my mouth look good, and how if I kept doing it, I would have no trouble from other male professors giving me good grades. I laughed nervously and left, never asking him for help again. ",Humanities,Other Type of School,Male,Undergraduate Student,Faculty,154
5,"A senior scholar whose work I greatly admired and who was like a grandfather mentor to me and my research team colleagues visited our campus. He was in his early 80's at the time, I was in my late 20's. The head of our research team, my mentor, hosted a dinner party for him with the students, and we enjoyed great food and liquor as we had very very profound theoretical conversation.  I was asked by my then mentor to drive him back to his hotel and when we arrived, he invited me up to his room for another drink and to talk about my work (so I thought).  We got up there, he indicated I should sit on the two-seat couch and he made me a drink and sat next to me on the couch although there was another chair. He then said, ""I want you to kiss me.""  I was so shocked and I wasn't fully processing what he was really doing. I didn't know what to do and he started moving towards me, so I compromised and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek (like in Latino culture), as I stood up, grabbed my coat, and headed for the door. I got out of there as quickly as I could.  I called my mentor and told her what happened.  She said, ""Damn, we thought because you were [my racial identity] that he wouldn't come on to you.  Guess not."" She knew he did this. He had done it to all the other women on the research team. I had no idea.  ", Social sciences,Other Type of School,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,273
6,"As an one of five female undergrads working at a remote field camp one summer, I dealt with a bunch of behavior from one of the two senior (male) PIs that made me very uncomfortable. The PI in question encouraged heavy drinking among all at the camp, and would give the women in the camp shoulder rubs, unsolicited hugs, etc. He was very charismatic, so at the time it was possible to laugh it all off, but it never felt quite right. There were about 15 of us in total at the camp, and we slept in one big bunk room. I can remember him sometimes coming into the bunk room late, leaning over my bunk (when I seemed to be asleep), and giving me a ‘goodnight kiss’. Blech. He also regularly made inappropriate, misogynistic statements  (“I don’t know why women have children - their asses never look the same again”). This was my first field job as an ecology student. The other senior PI (also male) turned a blind eye to this behaviour (he was very “focused on his science”). The grad students/other research associates at the camp went along with the atmosphere created by the first PI, no doubt because they were also walking a fine line between being in his good vs. bad books.",Natural sciences,Other Type of School,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,218
7,"In mid 2000s, I got invited to the on-campus apartment of a professor with the promise of meeting two huge scientists in my field (all male, of course). Professor was drugged and drunk and proceeded to grope me right in front of the senior scientists that I was trying to talk research with. They more or less ignored me and pretended not to notice the groping. When I extracted myself from that professor (and he fell asleep on the couch), the other scientists decided to leave but insisted I should stay ... which I didn't.
The professor started calling me later that night, insisting I needed to come back because he ""needed me there"". Next day he left roses on my desk with a note ""Sorry"" ... written on the back of a page of my research notes. It took that level of disrespect for my space and research work to notice that the whole thing had been inappropriate all along.

8,"A professor from another department and I had decided to co-edit a book together about food. It didn’t strike me as odd that we would talk about the book over dinner - it was a food studies book and dining was part of the research. At dinner he proceeded to drink a bottle of wine (I had one by-the-glass serving and refused to join him in the bottle). He put his hand on my leg; I moved it. This repeated many times, maybe ten. He tried to hold my hand as we left the restaurant. Invited me back to his place because his wife and child were away. I refused. Said I had to get my bike from my office which took me back into a building on campus. He decided to come with me. Tried to kiss me. I was so freaked out that I decided to skip trying to bike in Manhattan and just get a cab. He followed me out and when a cab stopped for me, he tried to push me and himself in. I braved myself against the doorframe and pushed him off. The next morning he emailed to say he had a great time and we should do it again. Years later I filed a report against him. The only reprimand that the EOE office had for him was to stop drinking with individual students. He was extremely uncomfortable but relaxed when they recounted the details (a sign that he had done something worse with someone else, perhaps?). He said he wouldn’t be able to do his food studies job, be himself, without being able to drink with students. The EOE office agreed and suggested he be more careful when drinking with individual students. That’s where it ended. Needless to say, I never got to co-edit that book with him which would have helped my career.", Social sciences,Other Type of School,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,312

10,"As an undergraduate, I took several classes with a professor who taught on a topic I enjoyed. He regularly gave me positive feedback on my work.  At some point, I asked him to become my advisor. At some point in my senior year, we went  out to lunch.  At the end of lunch, he told me his wife was out of town and asked if I wanted to come home with him for a martini. It was the middle of the day, on a weekday.

Over the years, I think I began to discount that memory, or my interpretation of it. Surely this full professor had not basically propositioned me when I was in college - I must have misremembered or imagined it.

Years later, as a postdoc, I ran into him at a conference that was being hosted at his institution (he had moved since I completed my undergrad). We briefly said hello, nothing more.

Later, when I landed a TT job, he reached out via email to congratulate me, and asked if I would be at a large conference that year. I was planning to attend, and was flattered that he was following my career.  I agreed to have dinner with him at the conference. We had dinner, and talked a great deal about my career trajectory.  He talked about his wife, and I talked about my partner of (at that time) 7 or 8 years, so there was no misunderstanding that we were both in committed relationships.  After dinner, he asked me up to his hotel room, which I politely declined.  As we said goodnight, he acted as if he would kiss me on the cheek.

We were friends for many years, corresponding frequently by email.  He read my work and gave me a lot of helpful advice.   He also came onto me at a conference and pressured me very strongly to come to his hotel room for sex.  When I rebuffed him, he ended his friendship with me entirely.

13,"1. During a dance composition class the professor instructed my partner to slap my but during a lift. My pelvis was on my partner's shoulder. The whole class laughed.

2. During a job interview I was instructed to not wear high heels to work. How the professor looked at me made me feel uncomfortable. He also didn't pay me on time and I had to demand payment. He said that part of the program was a criminal retraining program. I ended up feeling like a criminal. After working there for a few weeks I found out that he just got hired as a professor at the same university that I was attending.  

3. A fellow student commented on my ass as I was walking out of class. Not that it really matters, but I wasn't even wearing something that was tight. 

4. I was kissed on my hand while working on a group project outside of the classroom during class time by a person that I was dating. I felt embarrassed, like I had no choice in the interaction.

It wasn't until later that I found out that he'd physically assaulted her in lab one night.  Some time later he found out that she told me and got nasty towards both of us.  I reported him to the department, but the adviser didn't take me seriously and encouraged all of us to sit down to talk it out as she thought it was just a misunderstanding.  When he found out I had reported him, he told the department adviser that he wanted to shut me up and that if this continued he'd ruin mine and my friend's career by going to our adviser. I asked for and was granted a university restraining order against him, to which he responded by getting a restraining order against me, claiming that I was out to get him.  Though the restraining order prohibits discussing circumstances with other members of the university who are not involved, he told my entire lab group some story about how I was a crazy person and making up stories to get him kicked out.  I only found out when one of my labmates stopped speaking to me and told me I should have kept my mouth shut.  I alerted the Title IX office as well as a university office that he was violating his terms of the order and retaliating against me for coming forward.  University office didn't do anything.  Title IX had a very intimidating and aggressive interview process for both me and my friend, who was scared about coming forward in the first place.  Title IX concluded that they thought he was crazy but that he wasn't going to do anything and was going to be out of the country for the next couple of months.  No action taken.  We ended up telling my adviser because I was too scared to be in the lab alone with him.  My adviser agreed to keep us separate until he left.  The guy graduated, but he's still around.

16,"In the middle of a class discussion on early 20th century sociology, the professor proclaimed to the entire class that I was sexy, despite my being ""older than the rest"" of the students. This prof revels in his ""academic rebel"" persona and enjoys making outrageous/heavy-handed and un-PC remarks, often calling out students and engaging them in silly/ridiculous conversation related to some personal characteristic (name, state or country of origin, family status, religion, hobbies, etc.).  Usually it's all in good fun, but slightly uncomfortable/awkward.  This was the first time (in this class), however, he made a comment toward anyone that was sexual in nature.  I was so shocked that I gasped and laughed in surprise, but after the shock passed, really resented that he verbalized the idea that I'm some hottie Latina MILF.  I believe the professor actually thought he was complimenting me, however, now I always wonder what other students/faculty think of me, and whether my intellectual credibility is overshadowed by my appearance/ethnicity. I feel I constantly have to overcompensate intellectually while repressing personal expression to counteract any stereotypes that were raised/reinforced by that comment.

19,"December 1990. I had graduated from my B.A. in French, and was in France for a year. My advisor invited me to meet him and his wife for coffee one evening. Because I had babysat their two children through my undergraduate studies, I thought it was a lovely gesture, and agreed to meet them. The venue changed from a coffee house to a bar--again, not a problem, because I knew them well. I arrived, and my advisor was in his car smoking a joint, and beckoned to me to get in the car with him. He said that his wife couldn't make it, and asked if I wanted to go see a particularly gawdy Christmas light display with him nearby. He started the car, and drove toward it, then parked. He grabbed my hand and shoved it between his legs, and pulled me close. I was so stunned, I didn't know what to do, but pulled away while he told me of his stress getting tenure, then having terrible reviews from his graduate students the semester before. He kept talking, then drove back to the bar. We went inside, and I tried to act as though nothing was strange, then left quickly after finishing a beer.
I was upset, but thought he was high and would forget about a lapse in judgement. I did go to graduate school, and was forced to take a sparsely attended rhetoric class that he was teaching, because ***'s class was full. It was a topic I loved, but throughout the class, my professor continued to harass me, suggesting first that my paper was brilliant (but only gave me a B+), and offered to help me in his library carrel. I didn't go. He gave me information about a conference, and told me that I should submit a paper there. I hesitated, and he called me one night, asking me if I was going, so he would be sure to go, too. I didn't submit a proposal--even though it would have been a great opportunity for a first semester master's student. 
I avoided him for the rest of my studies, and did well. I was given a paid position assisting the editor of a major journal, and the graduate advisor asked me to stay for my PhD. 
Unfortunately, my professor presented a question on my master's exam that I could never have anticipated--it had nothing to do with my studies, and did not allow me to demonstrate what I did know, and so far from what other students were given that I was blown away. I knew a little--it was related to a French psychologist--and tried to answer, but was absolutely devastated, and sat in the exam sobbing for two hours before trying to write--about two pages, actually--then leaving. All the events in the car, and for that semester, came back to me, and I realized that he wanted me gone.
In my orals, the department head sat beside me, and reassured me as I talked about the other questions. The question from my harasser did not come up once, and I tried to mention it (had become nearly an expert by the time of those exams!), but the committee kept switching the topic, and then said that the question was ""unusual"". The harassing professor did not say much at all that day, which was very unlike him. 
The following week, the graduate advisor told me that he was ashamed of my written exam, and told me that I was not allowed to return. I did, however, pass my master's exam. I really felt that they wanted to get rid of me quickly and quietly.
I am incredibly grateful, in particular, to one professor, who believed me. He was excluded from my exam process because they scheduled the exam while he was on an extended trip to Brazil. He told me that he felt this had been intentional. He was extremely well regarded (***'s biographer, among other things), so it meant a lot to me that he tried to help me.

My boss, a full professor of engineering,  grabbed me from behind when we were in the office alone and forcibly  dry humped me. I asked him to stop the first time it happened. I was shocked and very upset. He laughed it off and told me he couldn’t resist my « comely posterior  » His words were cruder. I did not know how to report the incident and I was afraid, even, to tell my husband. This was 1983 and I was young. He did the same thing two more times to me although I tried to avoid and outrun him after the first incident. Ultimately, although I needed the job, I never came back from maternity leave and resigned because of the incidents.  I felt ashamed he had chosen  me to do it to and feared no one would believe me because I was pregnant. This same professor routinely required me to insert nudie photos of women into the a/v materials for his engineering class lectures to « wake the (predominantly male) students up. » Second incident: as an undergraduate student at the same university in 1988, full professor of botany who taught the botany class in which I was registered. The lab for the class involved each student being assigned a garden plot. He gave me a plot far away from other students and visiited me while I worked my plot, all the whlle making appreciative and graphic comments about my body.  He told me his wife was away and invited me to come with him to his house. I rebuffed him, saying I was married and the mother of two small children. As the semester went on, he continued  to visit me when I was wording my isolated garden plot and comment on my body as I worked. I was so uncomfortable that I decided my only option was to drop the class. He refused to sign the drop paperwork. I didn’t know how to report the incident, and when grade reporting time came, he recorded an « incomplete » and wrote  me, asking me to come to his office. I was afraid to be alone with him so I ignored his letter. Eventually the « incomplete » turned to an F. In a couple of years, I graduated with high honors.

25,"In a literature class, an older male professor asked women during class whether they’d ever been sexually harassed in academia. Most of us were uncomfortable and unsure how to answer. He kept asking the question, insisting that he did not think sexual harassment occured at our university. Some of us finally answered that we had witnessed, heard about, or experienced sexual harassment on campus (professors making comments about women’s bodies and appearances, unwanted touching, etc.), but kept it general because of the classroom setting we were in. One of my colleagues in class had experienced harassment, making this conversation very awkward and personal. All of the men were staring at the women with disbelief, waiting for us to share personal details of trauma. After we shared vague and anonymous accounta, the professor looked incredulous and proceeded to question whether our experiences had really occurred. I think he was genuinely in disbelief, but somehow didn’t realize that he was contributing to the problem. This professor also routinely made comments in class about undergraduate students’ bodies and clothing.

I've been told by male colleagues that in office hours he often asks them about their sex lives, and pressed at least one male student to admit that another female student (the prof's advisee) was attractive.

It was emphasized that as an undergraduate I was extraordinarily lucky to have this opportunity. I had to meet privately with the professor. It was a small office. We would sit at his desk and he would keep moving in on me until I was pinned to the wall. He would lean, brush, rub, and touch all the time, with many parts of his body. He doodled pornographic pictures on my notes. He would make odd noises. He set out cushions on the floor and tried to get me to sit there (I wouldn't) and stay the night (I didn't.) He would talk about my looks/body/hair. I usually dressed 'like a boy' in baggy work shirts, sweaters, and jeans anyway but I started wearing more layers and tying my hair up. I was inexperienced and naive. I kept to my studies and did not have girl friends to ask about problems. My Mom was working two jobs so I could go to college and I did not want to worry her. I just tried to ignore him, pretend it was not happening, and tried to do my work. It was the 1960s and there was no context to say anything. One day I went to the office and he swiveled in his chair and greeted me by wiggling a big banana which he was holding in his crotch. I ran away.  When I calmed down, I told my advisor , who had arranged the project, that I did not know what to do - I did not want to disappoint him or create any awkwardness, but I was upset. (I later heard rumors that this professor recruited students for threesomes with his wife, also a professor. I recalled that a few times they both showed up at my dorm dining hall - he knew which dorm I was in - like they had been waiting for me and then invited themselves to have dinner with me.

During my pregnancy, she repeatedly sent me articles describing how being pregnant impaired memory with notes about her  having to keep and eye on my work now that I wasn't going to be able to think anymore. After I had my child, she called me flaky (even though my performance had not changed) and told others that I'd been a great student until ""I got knocked up"" or until I had kids. A couple of years later, when we decided to have another baby, I didn't tell her in private because I was scared of her reaction. I announced it to her and the rest of the lab at a meeting and she growled and said, ""oh my God, I'm going to shoot you."" She laughed, but no one else did.

He was grooming me for the PHD program and acting as a mentor of sorts and invited me to meet some of his PHD students at a bar after school. He told me that he had to pick up some clothes at the dry cleaners first and then go home to change and drop them off- then we would go to the bar. He asked me to come with him in his car. I was very hesitant to do this. I knew that he had a history of dating his PHD students. I knew from a very good friend that he had left his wife of 30 years for one of his PHD students. 
Reluctantly I went in his car- wanting to meet the PHD students as my goal. When I entered into his house he gave me a tour and showed me every room including his bedroom. I felt very uncomfortable and immediately went downstairs and stood at the front door telling him i would wait there for him. 
Seconds later he came down the stairs with his jeans undone and his penis hanging out. He sat on the love seat in the living room and patted the seat beside him as an invitation to come sit beside him and do as he wished. I was stunned.

I left immediately and ran down the street crying. Called my husband from a pay phone and felt sick.

76,"As a young assistant professor at an art school I noticed an older adjunct faculty member who would lurk in the halls or appear out of nowhere and stare. Other colleagues agreed he was ""creepy."" Fast forward 10 years. I was now department chair and it came to my attention that this same guy, who taught poetry writing, was making female undergraduates pretty uncomfortable. Rather than teaching everyone together in a classroom, he held tutorials in his tiny office with the door closed so that he could work with each individual student on her writing. One student came forward when she received an envelope of poems at her home address (which she had not shared with him -- he had gotten the registrar to tell him where she lived). Although he would deny it, the poems were highly suggestive and personal, mentioning, for example, a tattoo on her leg and the street she lived on. He also called her on her cell phone and asked her questions about her boyfriend. He would have students bring some of their art to class so he could help them translate their inspiration into words; in her case he honed in on a photograph in which she appeared in the background, in the shadows, partly nude. (This was in that tiny office with the door closed.) The student filed a complaint, and I had her taken out of the class and asked another colleague to work with her through the rest of the semester so that she could get credit for the course. This was just the first incident. This student filed a complaint which was adjudicated through a complex system that included both the in-house sexual harassment procedure and the state-wide faculty union grievance process. His defense was that he was working very hard with each student to draw out their creative energy based on what he saw in their work, and of course, they explored all kinds of subjects in their work. The fact that they were 20 years old and he was somewhere in his 70s, supposedly mature enough to know where to draw the line, did not seem to register. He had several advocates in the department, all male and quite senior to me, who argued that his writing poems for the students was a matter of free speech, and that stopping it would cast a shadow over the principles of artistic freedom at the school. The poet was able to keep his job with a stern warning, an order not to have students in his office alone, and a remedial sexual harassment training program -- something required by state law that had not really been enforced for adjunct faculty, putting the university in a position of potential liability. He came to my office in the fall and told me he was very sorry, he now understood, and I would never have any trouble with him again. I told him I hoped he meant it. But of course he kept up the same behavior, choosing new students for his obsession each term. After the students saw that he had not been fired, they were very reluctant to bring new complaints against him, and feeling very upset that I had not been able to get justice for the first student, I did not feel I could push them to complain, as I could make no promises. I could only take the incident to the civil rights officer, but without a formal complaint we could go no further. Every time I went to him and told him I knew what he was up to, he wanted to know who complained, and whined about how he had a constitutional right to face his accuser. He denied and denied, and begged me not to take away the only meaningful thing left in his life. After a couple of these incidents he seems to have understood he couldn't do this with students in his class, but decided it would be ok to stalk random students he saw in the halls. Two years after my term was up, he turned his attention to a graduate student, followed her to the cafeteria, invited himself to have lunch with her, offered to help her with recommendations, etc. She didn't like it but she felt she had to be polite to a professor. Then he wrote a little play and e-mailed it to her. There was immediately a second e-mail saying ""maybe you shouldn't open that other e-mail but just delete it."" Naturally she opened it. It was very explicit. She brought it to public safety, who called HR, and at last he was escorted out of the building and banned from campus.
