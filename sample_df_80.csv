1,"There is a senior male scholar in my field who regularly--compulsively even--oversteps boundaries with most women he encounters in professional settings. Over the past decade (and I know from senior colleagues that this has gone on much longer), I have both experienced and witnessed inappropriate behavior from him on multiple occasions at conferences, invited talks, etc., including: 1. excessively touching/stroking women's arms, shoulders, and backs, 2. giving out French ""bisous"" that just happen, as if by accident, to land on the recipient's lips, 3. handing out his phone number with a casual invitation to visit him at his hotel later.

2,"First incident: As an undergrad in communication studies and SFSU in the '80's my instructor encouraged me to apply for the grad program. When I did, after I took the entry exam he invited me to his home in order to let me know his decision about my acceptance in to the program. I asked him if I got in and he said he hadn't decided yet. He told me that I had taken the wrong exam and my scores were borderline.  He gave me a tour of his house and in his marital bedroom showed me a picture of his son. He said, ""Isn't he handsome"" , ""Sure"" I said. ""Don't I look like him?"" he asked. ..I didn't know what to say, then he joked about me dating his son and then said he wasn't available, so why not date him instead? I was shocked and extremely uncomfortable I was young and nervous and didn't know what sexual harassment was but I just started getting sick to my stomach. I said, ""I am sorry, I have a boyfriend and I better get going now""  and I left his house flustered. Walking across the street away from his house I was terrified and shaken. I didn't know what was going on but I knew it wasn't good. I was depressed and sick to my stomach for days. Later I realized  he was holding the key to my future and was indirectly asking me to go to bed with him in order to get it. I felt glad that I didn't entirely understand what was happening at the time. I hadn't heard of sexual harassment or quid per quo. But later I always wondered if I got into the program on my own merit, because he needed new students in the program, or if he was afraid I would complain?", Social sciences,Other Type of School,Other,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,313

I had been in my position for only a few months at the time.

5,"First, let me say that I'm a male. While I know that around 10% of all sexual harassment incidents involve men as the victims, I think it is important for all to know that this happens to people of all identities.

While I was in graduate school at a major, private university, one of my male, professors would regularly make physical contact with me (kissing me, sticking his tongue in my ear, etc.). He was openly flirtatious with all but would become much more aggressive in private. I felt as if I had no choice but to allow this due to his status and power over my career and, at times, I felt like it might be something that was allowing me to remain in the program. This continued even after I concluded classes as I felt like I needed him as a reference.

I look back now in disgust at what he did but I fully remember the feeling that I had no choice but to submit. I think about this every day now that I'm a professor myself and wield the same power over grad students at a major university.

After I went to lunch with the 3rd, which was a bit too long for my comfort (an intellectual dialogue that lasted 5 hours) I felt uncomfortable when he left me several phone messages eager to get together again, distanced myself from him, removed him from my dissertation committee, and never had anything else to do with him for my remaining years in the program.  He seemed to get the message.  In that case I cannot be sure whether he was trying to cross the line but took no chances.

He had hoped to do it undetected by me but it was obvious in part, due to her expression.  I had never witnessed anything like this and did not know what to do.  I did nothing and pretended not to have noticed.  She was visibly embarrassed and stiffly took his hand and moved it away from her thigh.  I have often felt remorse at not having said anything and I have no idea whether the accounting professor had a relationship with this administrator or not.  What I do remember is how awkward the situation was how embarrassed the administrator looked when it happened.  She was much younger than him and unmarried.  He was married.

I personally have had students ask me out and become defensive when I said no. At another institution, a student did this, and then followed me to my car to harass me about why I wouldn't date him. I had to specifically say, ""are you going to follow me to my car?"" for him to leave me alone. 

A friend had a student send her inappropriate emails relating to male genitalia and how he would like to do particular things to her. She complained to the department head who said there was nothing they could do.

His class lectures frequently revolved around sex, which was unusual for a class in Christian Church History. He would say inappropriate things to the female students. One day he asked about what we think when a ‘hunk’ walks by. He would also make objectifying statements about women. When I complained about it he would tell me that some feminist theologians think that we need to be talking about push up bras and sexuality. He never respected me as a theologian and made clear his amusement of me, particularly when a male classmate made a disparaging remark towards me.

I doubted my own experiences until he finally commented on my “slinky dress,” (I was wearing a modest sleeveless blouse behind a podium) in a photo of me at a public speaking event at a local  church.

I ducked and made a hasty exit. He was invited to my graduation party, schmoozed with my friends and family, shook my father's hand, and then called me 6 times after he had left to ask if I had really meant it when I said 'love you' to him and his family as they left. He refused me feedback on my final paper unless we could 'go over it one on one' and sent me late night texts about how he missed me and wish we could slip away or travel to italy together.

I said no thank you, he persisted, and after the third effort to talk me into it despite stating repeatedly that I was happily married, I finally got up, said good night and left the party. I told my adviser about the incident the next day and expressed disinterest in working on any future collaborations. When we got back to the university, he required me to spend lab time on a collaborative project (that took time away from finishing my own work) with this person, despite what I had told him.

But his contempt for women was obvious. By that time he was in his 60s.
I took my qualifying exams and left the institution to scratch out a study site on my own to complete my dissertation. I fought hard - without meaningful letters of recommendation - for a career in academia. Even still, 20 years later, I do not have a network of invested academics 'who raised me'. 
The response of the institution - a female chair at the time- was cliche. ""Oh that's just how he is and we can't legislate love"".  LOVE?? 
It easily set my career back 10 years, but I guess, after having read so many stories of women ""hounded out"" (excellent terms, btw), I should consider myself ""one of the lucky ones"".
At that time in the late 80s and early 90s, several women were harassed in the short time I was there.

He followed her and continued to make comments. She was trying to open the bottle of wine and was having trouble getting the cork out. He started laughing and made a sexually suggestive comment about how it looked as she tugged on the neck of the bottle. All the students were stunned, there was some uncomfortable laughter. This same professor made comments publicly in his classroom about the attractiveness of a female colleague. He was an associate professor, she was a new assistant. He pulled up her ratemyprofessors profiled in class, she had a hot pepper rating for her attractiveness and he put a picture of her up and said that her body was attractive but not her face.

He was close friends with my other adviser, a feminist professor whom I had been working under for a long time and looked up to. He must have complained to her. When I asked her to write letters of recommendation for me for graduate school, she refused. She told me that she did not like how I had treated her friend, and therefore could not recommend me as a colleague. It was a consensual affair, so I do not blame him overly much, though clearly I was too young to be involved with him and there was a power imbalance in the relationship because of his role as my mentor.

The women themselves would not come forward because of the power pressure, but their peers came forward, both to voice their concerns and to complain about their perceptions of preferential treatment in the grad program. Both men ultimately felt that these relationships were ""justifiable"" or ""ethical""  because they ended up marrying their grad students, the most fragile of whom (the one who had been raped) gave up her graduate education, entered a marriage full of emotional and physical abuse, became a stereotypical version of the ""barefoot and pregnant"" cliche, and only recently divorced her husband (who, no surprise! was fooling around with grad students).
