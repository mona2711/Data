1,"When I was a student in his class, his touching (during class) progressed from a light touch on the shoulder to rubbing both shoulders and touching my neck. My boyfriend was also in the class and was incensed at his behavior. When I read with him for my dissertation, an older female student warned me that he needed to ""break"" his female students by making them cry and that, once I did, everything would be fine. He used harsh words and criticism during our study sessions together (but never touched me). I did not cry. During my general exam he berated me to such an extent that I expected to fail (I passed).",Humanities,Elite Institution,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,113
2,"The same person groped me while we were doing fieldwork, made explicitly sexual comments to me at work, often made implicitly sexual comments in many contexts.

3,"A mentor paid ambiguous and uncomfortable amount of time and energy on me that felt like (but was never articulated) a bid for a relationship. I worked for him as a teaching and research assistant. In thanks for my hard work, he took me out to dinner at a restaurant well beyond my means. As a private pilot, he also, for ostensibly other reasons, took me out for a day in his plane. I was too young to know how to decline or to determine whether I was making too much of his advances. I was quite alright, in the end. He never forced the issue and remained supportive of my work and career until his death. It was less of a physical attack and more of an emotional toll too heavy for a young academic worrying about her career, her status, appropriate responses, image in the department, real motivations, etc. In context, this mentor was a serial husband. He had 7 marriages by the time he died. I am quite unscathed, in the long run, and he was a very good mentor otherwise. But, I learned a lot that has prevented me from being in situations that would have likely turned out quite worse.",Humanities,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,205

Would loudly refer to women as “gutter sluts” and openly mocked women and minority members. Ranked women in the program by “sexual appeal” and let it be know who he would ranked the highest. Would also loudly make claims women and minority students had an easier  time getting into PhD programs due to the “sympathy vote.”  All this and more place in just out Fall semester of 2015.

A fellow faculty member had an affair with a married graduate student in the department, the student's marriage subsequently ended and eventually the relationship between the student and faculty member ended. The faculty member and student openly attended school functions and faculty gatherings together. This faculty member later began a relationship with a younger faculty colleague in the department.
2. Senior faculty member had affairs with two of their students which ended two of the faculty member's marriages.
3. Senior faculty member #2 had a relationship with their student and later married them on campus with some of the faculty member's current students performing at the wedding ceremony.

They were from different institutions. After drinks we walked and talked, and split up; the older one (who I was with) told me that we should go up to his room and talk. Once there, we kissed. He took his pants off and pushed my head to his penis, and asked me to give him a blow job (which I did.) Then he asked me to leave. I had no intention of doing anything sexual; I idolized him and wanted to talk with him. He used me for an orgasm and threw me away like a kleenex. My self esteem was shaken for years.

15,"I've been harassed and propositioned by both female and male colleagues. I've continually witnessed how senior male academics treat their junior and female colleagues, both in their objectification and in 'mansplaining' to them. I've seen women in academia change institutions to get away from the male dominance of power; which in some instances involved changing into disciplines that are more female-driven. I had to put in two separate and formal sexual harassment claims within my first two years at the same institution. I've seen male academics respect the mind of a female academic, but who have disrespectfully in turn attempted to desire her body as well.

17,"Male professor made several comments over the course of the semester about women being intellectually inferior. On one of my assignments, his comment was, “Your writing is lively and engaging, too bad you don’t know how to think.” Near the end of the semester, I had to give a presentation for the class. The screen wasn’t lowered completely when I began to speak, so he interrupted me, and told me to fix it. I walked over toward him and had to bend over quite low in my nice presentation dress to yank the screen the rest of the way down.

At another time, after they gave me the job, (presumably because I didn’t get up and walk out of that lunch or file a complaint about it) they joked about taking bets on how long I would last in Afghanistan as a reporter before I got raped. One of the two had fabricated press credentials (the other one assisted in this endeavor) so that he could travel there and bolster his CV by writing and publishing as a “war correspondent.” They bantered back and forth about the “over/under” of my potential rape until I managed to deflect the attention and redirect the conversation back to the literary journal we were supposed to be editing.

I was actually banned from taking a class in my discipline, in my specific subject, at a public institution and program into which I had been matriculated, owing to my complaints. I was denied employment opportunities for which I was not only qualified but the only candidate who was qualified. I am blackballed to this day in the local employment market.

20,"A professor from another department and I had decided to co-edit a book together about food. It didn’t strike me as odd that we would talk about the book over dinner - it was a food studies book and dining was part of the research. At dinner he proceeded to drink a bottle of wine (I had one by-the-glass serving and refused to join him in the bottle). He put his hand on my leg; I moved it. This repeated many times, maybe ten. He tried to hold my hand as we left the restaurant. Invited me back to his place because his wife and child were away. I refused. Said I had to get my bike from my office which took me back into a building on campus. He decided to come with me. Tried to kiss me. I was so freaked out that I decided to skip trying to bike in Manhattan and just get a cab. He followed me out and when a cab stopped for me, he tried to push me and himself in. I braved myself against the doorframe and pushed him off. The next morning he emailed to say he had a great time and we should do it again. Years later I filed a report against him. The only reprimand that the EOE office had for him was to stop drinking with individual students. He was extremely uncomfortable but relaxed when they recounted the details (a sign that he had done something worse with someone else, perhaps?). He said he wouldn’t be able to do his food studies job, be himself, without being able to drink with students. The EOE office agreed and suggested he be more careful when drinking with individual students. That’s where it ended. Needless to say, I never got to co-edit that book with him which would have helped my career.", Social sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,312

Although I wouldn't let him touch me, and never indicated I wanted more than friendship, he wanted to formally ""declare"" our imagined romance to the department.

Most classes, he would ""accidentally"" drop the battery pack in his pocket before turning the mic on. He had a tremor, so there was a plausible excuse, but he would ask me (a) to unbutton his shirt to clip the microphone on properly and then (b) reach into his pocket to take out the battery pack and turn it on (I was then expected to put it back into his pocket). This felt super weird and creepy, but I went with it because he made it clear that there wasn't another choice. Sometimes, during class, he would ask me to step outside of the classroom with him (into this little vestibule). He'd put his hand on my arm, look deep in my eyes, tell me that it was time for a break and he was going to head to his office, and to tell the students to come back / expect him back in 15 minutes.

The assistant director of housing began sexually harassing other females and myself. He was not our direct supervisor, though he was above us in rank. The harassment would vary from comments - comments made to me included that we should be married, as we acted like an old married couple - to unwanted touching. At one point, he would randomly hug us. My coworker was making copies, and he came up from behind her and wrapped his arms around her. 

My coworkers and I approached the associate director, our direct supervisor, who then approached the director of housing and our regional manager, each of whom were male. While the associate director advocated for strict action in the situation, the director and regional manager just told him to stay away from us. 

Unfortunately, the associate director took a position at another university in town, and after he left, we were forced to report directly to the assistant director. My peer, the one who had been hugged at the copy machine, also left, which left myself and our student employees.

There were about 15 of us in total at the camp, and we slept in one big bunk room. I can remember him sometimes coming into the bunk room late, leaning over my bunk (when I seemed to be asleep), and giving me a ‘goodnight kiss’. Blech. He also regularly made inappropriate, misogynistic statements  (“I don’t know why women have children - their asses never look the same again”). This was my first field job as an ecology student. The other senior PI (also male) turned a blind eye to this behaviour (he was very “focused on his science”).

Once I and my female colleagues make it clear that we will not defer to our male peers, we are subject to more exacting standards of evaluation and performance, more onerous teaching assignments, exclusion from institutional support for our academic projects, changes to student grades outside of institutional procedures, and lack of promotion or other institutional benefits. Also, I have been threatened with violence from male students on two occasions (once 8 years ago, and a second occasion 5 years ago). When I initially reported the incidents, administrators told me not to make a police report. When one student continued to make threats, my institution responded in a slow and inadequate manner that further marginalized me in my department and institution, putting me and my students at risk.

I tried for about 8 months to navigate it without rocking the boat until I finally asked a committee member to intervene and take over my committee. During the process of removing him from my committee, which required a meeting with every-freaking-body, he then began to spread rumors that I was sleeping with the person I asked to take over my committee and that's why I wanted to change my committee. On the contrary, my eventual adviser has warned me that it would be war with this guy if I changed my committee. This guy was the graduate coordinator at the time and he 'disappaeared' numerous forms to claim I hadn't met deadlines, only to find them after I presented my own copies (multiple times). Anyone who vocally supported me was retaliated against; he had a lot of friends in high places and was the social center of the department at the time. I had only two faculty members in the end who spoke up for me. I had one write me 'poison pen' letters because I didn't realize she was an ally of his, more than a mentor of mine. It was horrible, I was blackballed for several years, I had to sneak around to apply for a Ph.D. program AND had to tell my prospective Ph.D. adviser about all of this before I even really knew her,  I contemplated suicide, I contemplated leaving academics, and I had to worry for half a decade whether anybody thought I was a decent academic. I was so marginalized socially and professionally for years, it almost drove me out of the industry. I completely rolled over once speaking up incurred more abuse. I didn't know how to defend myself as a 20-something graduate student. I was astonished that everyone looked the other way with such ease.

One of the older graduate students in particular was designated as the first year student coordinator, and his role was to help us adjust to graduate student life. I wore a skirt to the party. I bent down to pick something up, and this student coordinator used the opportunity to put his hand up my skirt on my thigh -- in full view of an entire room of first year and older graduate students. I was humiliated and shocked, and no one did anything.

The next day, I told him it was inappropriate, and he told me I was wrong. 3) Another first year graduate student, previously my close friend, tried to initiate sex by putting his hand on my leg while I was drunk and falling asleep, even though he knew I had a boyfriend. He knew that I would not have consented if I had been sober, and he didn't stop when I said no. I lost my best friend.

We sat down on the couch and he served me a bizarre strong liqueur that I didn't drink. Suddenly, in the middle of our conversation, he threw himself on top of me, kissing me even as I squirmed away. He groped me, tried to push himself into my underwear under my skirts,  and kept trying to French-kiss me as he attempted to undress me. Somehow I managed to push him off me. He then cried and said he was lonely and begged me to stay to eat something. I was terrified he'd bad-name me to my other professors in the department so I stayed. The ""meal"" was almost worse than the groping: for two hours, he didn't ask me anything about my research or give me any real advice but instead made me listen to his problems with his relationships, divorce, etc. After that day, he made no effort to find out how my research on my senior thesis was progressing--or even if I had found someone else to supervise my project.",Humanities,Elite Institution,Male,Undergraduate Student,Graduate Student,228

Finally, after the last guests left, I insisted that he leave.  I was angry and tired, and had only had a little food all day and then a glass of champagne that evening.  I threw up and he rushed to the bathroom to ""help"" me - with me telling him to leave, that the party was over, and I did not feel well.  Instead, he pushed me into the bedroom, insisting that he only wanted to ""help"" me.  He raped me, then acted as if this had been a romantic start to a relationship and asked when we could go out again.  I disagreed.  He left.  I emailed him a few days later to tell him to stay away from me and that it had been non-consensual, rape.  He has stayed away since then.

This occurred in front of other students, but it is likely that no one else really noticed. I physically recoiled, stepped back and maintained my physical distance from this man for the rest of the weekend. I did not receive the full-ride scholarship, but I did receive a lesser scholarship.

Coffee and snacks were without incident, but then he suggested we take a walk to the nearby park as it was such a nice day. I agreed. As we walked there, he reached out to take my hand. I was shocked. He held if for a little while, and then I pretended I needed something from my handbag and disengaged my hand. After that I made sure to have my handbag on the side between us so he couldn't hold my hand again. We sad on the grass in the park where he lay down and opened a few of his shirt buttons.
2. During a separate conversation, or maybe during a conversation when he was in my city, he told me about how his wife and him went to nude beaches. 
3. At AoIR in Denver, I ran into him near the escalators and we were chatting and catching up. A young Southeast Asian woman was coming up the escalator and he stopped in mid-sentence and said something like, ""Oh wow I need to get to know *her*!"" in a creepy desperate sexual way.

He supposedly had  very low visitors' chairs, so he could look between his female PhD students' knees and many more disgusting stories. After many women had complained about his inappropriate behaviour, he was banned from having female PhD students. That of course meant that these women had less options and he would only help other male PhD students to finish their degrees. When I adressed one of his (male) colleagues (I will call him colleague 2) and told him about this professor's innappropriate behaviour, he just shrugged and said that this was this person's ""normal"" behaviour and I shouldn't take it too seriously.

Years later colleague 1 died and colleague 2 wrote an overwhelmingly positive eulogy on colleague 1, praising his many professional merits. Like so often, they (all the male colleagues) knew exactly what was going on but they chose to ignore it or behave innappropietly themselves.

I believe he had started to display obsessive behaviour, and had begun to calculate my movements, and to stalk me. I had noticed that prior to me attempting to step back, his verbal interactions with me increasingly resulted in me feeling manipulated and disempowered.

He claimed I had no ability to ""have fun"".  Later in the afternoon, we were working with radioactive substances, and he once again closed the door and put his hands around me.  This time he bit and licked my right earl. I told him to stop and it hurt.  He laughed.  ",Applied science,Research Institute,Male,Undergraduate Student,Graduate Student,110
86,"I was outside of the U.S. doing PhD research. I went to a conference in the country where I was doing my research, and the cost of the hotel rooms were covered by the organization planning the conference. At the end of the conference, the very large and tall conference organizer knocked at the door of my room, and when I opened the door, he stepped so close to me that I stepped back and he came into my room. He made lame small talk, and I immediately grabbed my bag and told him I was going out and left the room. So, he did not assault me, but he certainly made me feel uncomfortable and I could tell what he was after. When I came back to my room later, I sat in bed with the lights out. I heard several knocks at the door but I did not answer them. I was so furious I could not sleep that night.",Humanities,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,162
87,"A professor who taught a class I was taking told me I reminded him of his wife ""back when he was actually attracted to her"" and later said he wished his son (who was my age) could meet me, though I ""would be way out of his league."" A couple other professors and my advisor would say that he mentioned/talked about me a lot; he also unexpectedly started showing up to the coffeeshop I worked at off-campus very often. ",Humanities,Elite Institution,Other,Graduate Student,Faculty,80
88,A tenured professor and later the chair who was working with grad students would give teaching gigs and opportunities for additional employment/income/professional development based on gender and sexual orientation and also based on what other professors you worked with. This professor/chair also told inappropriate jokes in class and outed (though sarcastic mean-spirited jokes) LGBT students in class. This professor got away with it because she was a lesbian and it was disguised as playful. In class this professor would also question certain students intellect and make inappropriate jokes about not knowing about certain fields of research or not immediately grasping concepts/theories. ,Humanities,Research Institute,Female,Graduate Student,Chair/Dean/Head,102
89,"I was at a reception for conference attendees while attending a small conference  on the topic I was wanting to study for my PhD. A senior scientist in my field who was very well known was introduced to me and responded with, ""Oh I know XX, I left my cufflinks in her room last night,"" while laughing. I thought it was strange. Later I was a PhD student and was collaborating with this same senior scientist. I was visiting his country for 3 weeks while learning new techniques. We were supposed to get together for dinner to discuss science and ideas for research. He suggested I come to his hotel room to have dinner with him there since he had recently moved to a more distant city and would only come to town once per month. Much to my relief, it happened to be snowing (in a place it doesn't usually snow) on the day he was in town so I didn't end up meeting him at his hotel.

90,"A married colleague said he wanted to kiss me at a graduate student happy hour in Spring 2015. An officemate, a graduate student in the department showed me a dic pic (not his own) without my consent. That incident didn't bother me so much as it was just annoying, particularly as that student claims to be a feminist and an activist, but I wouldn't say I've lost any sleep over it.",Humanities,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,71
91,"I used to volunteer in a virology lab in 2012. Postdoc was not helpful...belittled my work, told me to do something, then it would go wrong, then he would blame me for it when I followed his instructions to the letter. Postdoc would flirt heavily with two other girls in the lab. There was one in particular that would work at the same times as me, and sometimes I witnessed inappropriate behavior (he would touch her breast or hug her, she would protest and move away uncomfortably, he would laugh, she would giggle in awkwardness). I felt bad for the girl because she was an international student and clearly did not like the attention. One time it got to me and I asked her if she was ok after an ""encounter"" with the postdoc. She was nervous but did not want to cause a scene. I left after about 1.5 years. It was an utter waste of time, I learned nothing. When I initially joined I had of course been promised publications but never got on any, and when I mentioned how I was disappointed, of course the postdoc said that it was due to my poor quality of work. A few months later, I get a call from the Title 9 officer at my university saying that the Postdoc had been accused of sexual harassment by 3 other girls (besides the two that worked with me). She asked if I had been a victim. I said no, I had not, but I witnessed it happening to the international student and that I felt like my time at the lab had been poorly spent. Nothing happened to the guy, obviously. I got an insincere apology from the Title 9 officer and the university covered their behinds. That was it.",Natural sciences,Elite Institution,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,299
92,"Female peer made inappropriate and unwanted sexual advances toward me over an extended period of time—3 semesters. Touching, standing too close, online stalking. I repeatedly expressed non-interest but the behavior continued and worsened. As a male, it was nearly impossible to get her to stop without seeming like a jerk. I wanted to yell at her to leave me alone, but it doesn’t look good, you know? A guy yelling at a girl in the middle of class. ",Humanities,Research Institute,Female,Graduate Student,Undergraduate Student,79
93,"I was working as a summer research assistant on a project with a colleague of my advisor. The colleague was a professor at another university in a different state, which is where the research project took place. On the first day of the project (and the first day I met the professor) he and I camped at the field site.  When it came time to set up camp we only had one small tent so I decided to sleep in the car.  He told me I was being a prude and that I should sleep in the tent.  I slept in the car.  At the time I didn't think too much about it, it's only after reading about harassment in academia that I realize how inappropriate it was for a 50 year old man to try to pressure a 22 year old woman into sharing a small tent with him. ",Natural sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,155
94,"The first time I met the (esteemed, tenured) professor I was supposed to spend my PhD years working, he caressed my hand when when shook hands, and then made me sit close to him on his couch instead of in a chair across from his desk. I had been warned that he ""likes French women."" Over the past couple of years, I have seen him touch women without their consent on multiple occasions. He obviously gets a kick out of toeing the line between ""vaguely inappropriate"" and downright unacceptable. I have since changed my entire study focus in order to avoid working with him. Half of the department ignores his behavior or says he's ""just an old man,"" and the other half won't rally against him in fear of what he could do to our careers.",Humanities,Regional College,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,136
95,"a 30""x40"" collage of explicit close-up vagina photos, clipped from pornography and pasted to poster board, was taped to my first floor dorm window in the dead of night. I was awakened to phone call with a creepy whispering voice to ""look out my window"". I was frightened and called campus security instead. When they arrived, they searched the window from the outside and found the sexually explicit ""artwork"". They did not find the perpetrator. I then called a male friend for support and heard laughter. He was with 3 or 4 buddies. I had no idea that someone I considered a friend would do something so aggressive. And he did it in tandem with other men. ",Humanities,Elite Institution,Other,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,118
96,"I don't even know where to start, so many things happened when I was a graduate student. One professor made wildly inappropriate comments and discussions about his sexual past in class. Every class. He once asked me, when I came to class with a bruise on my face from falling off of my bike, ""What? Does your boyfriend beat you or something?"" (in front of the entire class). Another professor physically assaulted me by slapping my arm hard and grabbing it to get me off of a wheelchair ramp (I didn't realize it was a wheelchair ramp, and there wasn't a wheelchair user coming). He later screamed at me in front of undergraduate students. I had a male graduate student peer smack me on the backside with his backpack when were were standing in front of an entire lecture hall full of undergraduates. When I was an undergraduate a departmental admin. assistant started a rumor that I was sleeping with a male professor. Oh, I have also faced some  awful harassment from some male undergraduates, when I was a graduate student and again as a Visiting Assistant Professor.",Humanities,Multiple,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,189
97,"A person with whom I was doing a problem set tried to force himself on me sexually, even though I tried to politely say no. Ultimately, I had to stop being polite about it. He then started following me after class and tried to apologize by saying 'in my country, no doesn't always mean no.' (He was from Argentina.)",Formal sciences,Research Institute,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,59
98,"A famous poet and infamous creep, died in 2002 with a perfect literary reputation. Overtly sexist and inappropriate in class, trading on grades and the annual literary awards (of which he was sole judge), obsessive and stalking behavior. Had male acolytes for whom he was ""like a father"" who served to protect and clean up his messes for him.",Humanities,Elite Institution,Male,Graduate Student,Faculty,59
99,"When I was a prospective PhD student, a department flew out the admitted students to campus for a visit. I met with a senior faculty member in my field--someone whose work I admired greatly, who had been the person who called to offer me a spot in the program. We spoke for a bit about the department and my research, and then he abruptly began to tell me about a museum he thought I should visit while I was in town. He pulled their catalog down from a shelf, drew his chair close to me so that our knees were touching, and placed the book in my lap. Then he slowly leafed through it and showed me all the pictures of naked women. My research was not related to naked women. ",Humanities,Elite Institution,Male,Graduate Student,Graduate Student,132
